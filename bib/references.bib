   abstract = {In the course of a non-equilibrium continuous phase transition, the dynamics ceases to be adiabatic in the vicinity of the critical point as a result of the critical slowing down (the divergence of the relaxation time in the neighborhood of the critical point). This enforces a local choice of the broken symmetry and can lead to the formation of topological defects. The Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) was developed to describe the associated nonequilibrium dynamics and to estimate the density of defects as a function of the quench rate through the transition. During recent years, several new experiments investigating formation of defects in phase transitions induced by a quench both in classical and quantum mechanical systems were carried out. At the same time, some established results were called into question. We review and analyze the Kibble-Zurek mechanism focusing in particular on this surge of activity, and suggest possible directions for further progress.},

   abstract = {We study the relaxation of a two-dimensional (2D) ultracold Bose gas from a nonequilibrium initial state containing vortex excitations in experimentally realizable square and rectangular traps. We show that the subsystem of vortex gas excitations results in the spontaneous emergence of a coherent superfluid flow with a nonzero coarse-grained vorticity field. The stream function of this emergent quasiclassical 2D flow is governed by a Poisson-Boltzmann equation. This equation reveals that maximum entropy states of a neutral vortex gas that describe the spectral condensation of energy can be classified into types of flow depending on whether or not the flow spontaneously acquires angular momentum. Numerical simulations of a neutral point vortex model and a Bose gas governed by the 2D Gross-Pitaevskii equation in a square reveal that a large-scale monopole flow field with net angular momentum emerges that is consistent with predictions of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation. The results allow us to characterize the spectral energy condensate in a 2D quantum fluid that bears striking similarity to similar flows observed in experiments of 2D classical turbulence. By deforming the square into a rectangular region, the resulting maximum entropy state switches to a dipolar flow field with zero net angular momentum.},

   abstract = {In a two-dimensional (2D) turbulent fluid containing point-like vortices, Lars Onsager predicted that adding energy to the fluid can lead to the formation of persistent clusters of like-signed vortices, i.e., Onsager vortex (OV) clusters. In the evolution of 2D superfluid turbulence in a uniform disk-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), it was discovered that a pair of OV clusters with opposite signs can form without any energy input. This striking spontaneous order was explained as due to a vortex evaporative-heating mechanism, i.e., annihilations of vortex-antivortex pairs which remove the lowest-energy vortices and thereby boost the mean energy per vortex. However, in our search for exotic OV states in a boundaryless 2D spherical BEC, we found that OV clusters never form despite the annihilations of vortex pairs. Our analysis reveals that contrary to the general belief, vortex-pair annihilation emits intense sound waves, which damp the motion of all vortices and hence suppress the formation of OV clusters. We also present unequivocal evidences showing that the true mechanism underlying the observed spontaneous OV state is the escaping of vortices from the BEC boundary. Uncovering this mechanism paves the way for a comprehensive understanding of emergent vortex orders in 2D manifolds of superfluids driven far from equilibrium.},

Universal power-law distributions, previously found within a nonperturbative quantum-field theoretical approach and recently shown to be related to vortical dynamics and superfluid turbulence, are studied in detail. The results imply an interpretation of the scaling behavior in terms of independent vortex excitations of the superfluid and show that the statistics of topological excitations can be described in the framework of wave turbulence. The particular scaling exponents observed in the single-particle momentum distributions are found to be consistent with irreversibility as well as conservation laws obeyed by the wave interactions. Moreover, long-wavelength acoustic excitations of the vortex-bearing condensate, driven by vortex annihilations, are found to follow a nonthermal power law. Considering vortex correlations in a statistical model, the long-time departure from the nonthermal fixed point is related to vortex-antivortex pairing. The studied nonthermal fixed points are accessible in cold-gas experiments. The results shed light on fundamental aspects of superfluid turbulence and have strong potential implications for related phenomena, for example, in early universe inflation or quark-gluon plasma dynamics. © 2012 American Physical Society.},

One prominent universal element of many continuous phase transitions is the spontaneous formation of topological defects during a quench through the critical point. The microscopic dynamics of defect formation in such transitions are generally difficult to investigate, particularly for superfluids. However, Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) offer unique experimental and theoretical opportunities for probing these details. Here we present an experimental and theoretical study of the BEC phase transition of a trapped atomic gas, in which we observe and statistically characterize the spontaneous formation of vortices during condensation. Using microscopic theories that incorporate atomic interactions and quantum and thermal fluctuations of a finite-temperature Bose gas, we simulate condensation and observe vortex formation in close quantitative agreement with our experimental results.

By applying a time-splitting technique for decoupling the nonlinearity and properly using the alternating direction implicit (ADI) technique for the coupling in the angular momentum rotation term in the GPE, at every time step, the GPE in rotational frame is decoupled into a nonlinear ordinary differential equation (ODE) and two partial differential equations with constant coefficients. This allows us to develop new time-splitting spectral (TSSP) methods for computing the dynamics of BEC in a rotational frame. The new numerical method is explicit, unconditionally stable, and of spectral accuracy in space and second order accuracy in time. Moreover, it is time reversible and time transverse invariant, and conserves the position density in the discretized level if the GPE does. Extensive numerical results are presented to confirm the above properties of the new numerical method for rotating BEC in 2D & 3D.},

The growth rates of the instabilities on the upper branch are so small that an arbitrarily specified initial perturbation of a rarefaction wave at first usually evolves towards the upper branch as it acoustically radiates away its excess energy. This is demonstrated through numerical integrations of the GP equation starting from an initial state consisting of an unstable rarefaction wave and random non-axisymmetric noise. The resulting solution evolves towards, and remains for a significant time in the vicinity of, an unperturbed unstable rarefaction wave. It is shown however that, ultimately (or for an initial state extremely close to the upper branch), the solution evolves onto the lower branch or is completely dissipated as sound. It is shown how density depletions in uniform and trapped condensates can generate rarefaction waves, and a simple method is suggested by which such waves can be created in the laboratory.},

Through numerical simulations of the two-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equations, we reveal different kinds of dynamical trajectories of the vortices depending on the combinations of signs of circulations and the intercomponent density coupling. Under the adiabatic limit, we derive the equations of motion for the vortex coordinates, in which the motion is caused by the balance between Magnus force and the intervortex forces. The initial velocity of the vortex motion can be explained quantitatively by this point vortex approximation, but understanding the long-time behavior of the dynamics needs more consideration beyond our model.},

For a binary BEC in a ring trap we find that the number of domains forming the pattern scales as a function of the coupling quench rate with an exponent as predicted by the KZM. For a binary BEC in an elongated harmonic trap we find a different scaling law due to the transition being spatially inhomogeneous.

We test the accuracy of the Turner model for two oppositely charged PCVs, via comparisons with numerical simulations. While the bare Turner model shows discrepancies with our numerical results, we find that a simple rescaling of the PCV mass gives much better agreement. This can be explained via a phenomenological damping arising from coupling to modes extrinsic to the point-vortex phase space. We also identify the excitations produced following PCV annihilation, which help elucidate recent phase ordering results. We extend the Turner model to cases where the system is magnetized both transversally and axially, identifying a crossover to scalar vortex dynamics for increasing external Zeeman field.},

We study the quench dynamics for a variety of q values and show that there is a single dynamic critical exponent to characterize the scale-invariant domain growth for each ferromagnetic phase. For both quenches we give simple analytic models that capture the essential scale-invariant dynamics and correctly predict the exponents. Because the order parameter for each phase is different, the natures of the domains and the relevant topological defects in each type of coarsening are also different. To explore these differences we characterize the fractal dimension of the domain walls and the relationship of polar-core spin vortices to the domains in the easy-plane phase.

   abstract = {Predicting the dynamics of quantum systems far from equilibrium represents one of the most challenging problems in theoretical many-body physics1,2. While the evolution of a many-body system is in general intractable in all its details, relevant observables can become insensitive to microscopic system parameters and initial conditions. This is the basis of the phenomenon of universality. Far from equilibrium, universality is identified through the scaling of the spatio-temporal evolution of the system, captured by universal exponents and functions. Theoretically, this has been studied in examples as different as the reheating process in inflationary Universe cosmology3,4, the dynamics of nuclear collision experiments described by quantum chromodynamics5,6, and the post-quench dynamics in dilute quantum gases in non-relativistic quantum field theory7–11. However, an experimental demonstration of such scaling evolution in space and time in a quantum many-body system has been lacking. Here we observe the emergence of universal dynamics by evaluating spatially resolved spin correlations in a quasi-one-dimensional spinor Bose–Einstein condensate12–16. For long evolution times we extract the scaling properties from the spatial correlations of the spin excitations. From this we find the dynamics to be governed by an emergent conserved quantity&nbsp;and the transport of spin excitations towards low momentum scales. Our results establish an important class of non-stationary systems whose dynamics is encoded in time-independent scaling exponents and functions, signalling the existence of non-thermal fixed points10,17,18. We confirm that the non-thermal scaling phenomenon involves no fine-tuning&nbsp;of parameters, by preparing different initial conditions and observing the same scaling behaviour. Our analogue quantum simulation approach provides the basis with which to reveal the underlying mechanisms and characteristics of non-thermal universality classes. One may use this universality to learn, from experiments with ultracold gases, about fundamental aspects of dynamics studied in cosmology and quantum chromodynamics. The emergence of universal dynamics far from equilibrium is observed by evaluating spatially resolved spin correlations in a quasi-one-dimensional spinor Bose–Einstein condensate.},

This article reviews experimental and theoretical progress in understanding the static and dynamic properties of these fluids. The connection between system properties and the rotational symmetry properties of the atomic states and their interactions are investigated. Following a review of the experimental techniques used for characterizing spinor gases, their mean-field and many-body ground states, both in isolation and under the application of symmetry-breaking external fields, are discussed. These states serve as the starting point for understanding low-energy dynamics, spin textures, and topological defects, effects of magnetic-dipole interactions, and various nonequilibrium collective spin-mixing phenomena. The paper aims to form connections and establish coherence among the vast range of works on spinor Bose gases, so as to point to open questions and future research opportunities. © 2013 American Physical Society.},

We determine where the condensate goes out of equilibrium as it approaches the critical point, and compute the condensate magnetization at the critical point. This is done within a quantum Kibble-Zurek scheme traditionally employed in the context of symmetry-breaking quantum phase transitions. Then we study the influence of the non-equilibrium dynamics near a critical point on the condensate magnetization. In particular, when the quench stops at the critical point, nonlinear oscillations of magnetization occur. They are characterized by a period and an amplitude that are inversely proportional. If we keep driving the condensate far away from the critical point through the unmagnetized 'symmetric' polar phase, the amplitude of magnetization oscillations slowly decreases reaching a nonzero asymptotic value. That process is described by an equation that can be mapped onto the classical mechanical problem of a particle moving under the influence of harmonic and 'anti-friction' forces whose interplay leads to surprisingly simple fixed-amplitude oscillations. We obtain several scaling results relating the condensate magnetization to the quench rate, and verify numerically all analytical predictions. © IOP Publishing Ltd and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.},

   abstract = {Quantum vortices in the multi-component Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) are investigated theoretically. It is found that three kinds of the vortex configurations are possible and their physical properties are discussed in details, including the density distribution and the spin texture. By using the Bogoliubov theory extended to the three component BEC, the collective modes for these vortices are evaluated. The local vortex stability for these vortices are examined in light of the existence of the negative eigenvalue, yielding a narrow magnetiza-tion window for the local intrinsic stable region where the multi-components work together to stabilize a vortex in a self-organized way. There have been much attention focused on Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) realized in alkali-metal atom gases. 1-3) In particular, since two experimental groups 4-8) have succeeded in producing quantum vor-tices in a rotating trapped BEC in 87 Rb system, many researchers investigate various aspects of this quantized vortex in the hope to obtain the better understanding of physical nature of superfluidity in this dilute weakly interacting Bose system. Here we have a better controlled mathematical tool, namely, Bogoliubov theory to treat it, compared with superfluid 4 He where no established microscopic theory to treat this strongly interacting Bose condensed system is known. In a series of our papers 9-12) we have been studying the problem of the intrinsic instability of a vortex in BEC. We point out the existence of the negative eigenvalue in the Bogoliubov excitation spectrum, 9) demonstrating that a quantized vortex in BEC confined by a rigid wall is intrinsically unstable and corresponding to the Rokhsar instability 13) due to the spiraling-out of a vortex core in a harmonically trapped BEC. Independently, the existence of the negative value is pointed by Dodd et al. 14) In order to arrest this instability and to stabilize it, we propose several practical devices feasible experimentally, such as sending a laser light at the core center to raise the potential which moves up the whole Bogoliubov spectrum as a result, or raising temperature and increasing the non-condensate fraction relative to the condensation which acts as an extra potential. 11) A similar recovering method is proposed by Doi and Natsume 15) who consider the two component BEC. We also examine the external rotation effect 10) on the vortex stability and determine the several characteristic critical rotation frequencies, 12) including the lowest critical frequency which signals the first entry of a vortex upon increasing the forced rota-* tion. This particular value 12) is by far nearer to the observed stirring frequency in the recent vortex creation experiment by optical spoon 6-8) than that estimated by the conventional Thomas-Fermi approximation. This coincidence further encourages us to perform the present study along this line. So far in all the theories and experiments mentioned above the internal degrees of freedom in an atom is frozen by the external magnetic field serving as a confining potential. By means of optical confinement, all the hy-perfine states with F = 1 in 23 Na are active and three components with m F = 1, 0, −1 are simultaneously Bose-condensed, 16) giving rise to a new state of matter; a BEC characterized by a vectorial order parameter. 17) Ohmi and Machida, 18) and Ho 19) independently introduce the basic Hamiltonian for describing this spinor BEC by extending the Bogoliubov framework and study the fundamental properties of this interesting spinor BEC, pointing out the richness of the topological defect structures such as the l-vector textures, domain wall structure, etc. These are very analogous to the 3 He superfluid A and B phases. 20) Again as the basic interaction in these super-fluid Fermions is strong, we have to resort to the strong coupling theory to describe it. The existing theories for superfluid 3 He is quite phenomenological and difficult to understand microscopically. In contrast, our theory here is quite microscopic and there is no room to introduce phenomenological parameters in it. Guided by this analogy, we are going to study here the vortex structures in more details. Yip 21) gave the first study on a vortex in the spinor BEC, classifying the possible vortex structures as functions of the interaction strength of the spin channel and the magnetization of the system. Unfortunately, some of the vortices introduced by Yip (I and IV phases in ref. 21) are simply not allowed because the fundamental phase requirement is violated for these particular vortices (see eq. (10)). Leonhardt and Volovik 22) propose the half-quantum vortex (Alice 1604},

We start with a pseudo spin-1/2 BEC system with/without an internal atomic Josephson junction and spin-orbit coupling including (i) existence and uniqueness as well as non-existence of ground states under different parameter regimes, (ii) ground state structures under different limiting parameter regimes, (iii) dynamical properties, and (iv) efficient and accurate numerical methods for computing ground states and dynamics. Then we extend these results to spin-1 BEC and spin-2 BEC. Finally, extensions to dipolar spinor systems and/or general spin-F (F≥3) BEC are discussed.},

Constructing spinor wave functions for vortex states that continuously connect ferromagnetic and polar phases, we systematically derive analytic models for nonrotating cores of different singular vortices and for composite defect states with distinct small- and large-distance topology. We explain how the conservation law provides a stabilizing mechanism when the coreless vortex imprinted on the condensate relaxes in the polar regime of interatomic interactions. The resulting structure forms a composite defect: The inner ferromagnetic coreless vortex deforms toward an outer singly quantized polar vortex. We also numerically show how other even more complex hierarchies of vortex-core topologies may be stabilized. Moreover, we analyze the structure of the coreless vortex also in a ferromagnetic condensate and show how reducing magnetization leads to a displacement of the vortex from the trap center and eventually to the deformation and splitting of its core where a singular vortex becomes a lower-energy state. For the case of singular vortices, we find that the stability and the core structure are notably less influenced by the conservation of magnetization.},

@report{Borgh2017,
   abstract = {We calculate the energetic structure of defect cores and propose controlled methods to imprint a nontrivially entangled vortex pair that undergoes non-Abelian vortex reconnection in a biaxial nematic spin-2 condensate. For a singular vortex, we find three superfluid cores in addition to depletion of the condensate density. These exhibit order parameter symmetries that are different from the discrete symmetry of the biaxial nematic phase, forming an interface between the defect and the bulk superfluid. We provide a detailed analysis of phase mixing in the resulting vortex cores and find an instability dependent upon the orientation of the order parameter. We further show that the spin-2 condensate is a promising system for observing spontaneous deformation of a point defect into an "Alice ring" that has so far avoided experimental detection. Topological defects and textures are ubiquitous across physical systems that seemingly have little in common [1], from liquid crystals [2] and superfluids [3] to cosmic strings [4]. They arise generically from symmetries of a ground state that is described by an order parameter [5]-a function parametrizing the set of physically dis-tinguishable, energetically degenerate states. In the simple example of a scalar superfluid, the order parameter is the phase of the macroscopic wave function. More generally it may be a vector or tensor that is symmetric under particular transformations. In a uniaxial nematic (UN), the order parameter is cylindrically symmetric around a locally defined axis. It also exhibits a twofold discrete symmetry under reversal of the cylinder axis, which leads to half-quantum vortices (HQVs) in atomic spinor Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) [6-9] and superfluid liquid 3 He [10], and to π disclinations in liquid crystals [1, 2]. In a biaxial nematic (BN), also the cylindrical symmetry is broken into the fully discrete symmetry of a rectangular brick, with dramatic consequences: the BN is the simplest order parameter that supports non-Abelian vor-tices that do not commute [5, 11]. As a result, colliding non-Abelian vortices cannot reconnect without leaving traces of the process, but must instead form a connecting rung vortex. Noncommuting defects appear as cosmic strings in theories of the early universe [4], and have been predicted in BN liquid crystals [11]. Despite long-standing experimental efforts, BN phases in liquid crystals have experimentally proved more elusive than originally anticipated [12]. In atomic systems, the topological classification and dynamics of non-Abelian vortices have theoretically been studied in the cyclic phase of spin-2 [13-16] and in spin-3 BECs [17], though it remains uncertain whether any alkali-metal atoms exhibit the corresponding ground states. Consequently, any physical system where non-Abelian defects may be reliably studied is still lacking. Spin-2 BECs exhibit-in addition to the ferromagnetic (FM) and cyclic phases-both UN and BN phases [18-20], which, however, are degenerate at the mean-field level. Beyond mean-field theory, the degeneracy may be lifted by quantum fluctuations through interaction-dependent "order-by-disorder" processes [18, 19]. Here, we instead break the degeneracy already at the mean-field level with a Zeeman shift and compute the energetically (meta)stable defect structures as well as propose a scheme for experimentally preparing vortices exhibiting non-Abelian reconnection. This shows how BN spin-2 BECs can provide an experimentally simple path to study structure and dynamics of non-Abelian defects. For an energetically stable singular vortex in a rotating system, we fully characterize the appearance of three su-perfluid core structures, in addition to the empty core. As well as one FM and one cyclic order-parameter core, a third superfluid core appears that exhibits a twofold symmetry, with cyclic and BN phases appearing offset inside the core. We provide a parametrization of the vor-tex wave function that captures the symmetry breaking and mixing of phases in the core. The structure of the superfluid cores results from a combination of energet-ics and topology as an interface forms between the BN phase of the bulk superfluid and the different symmetry of the core order parameter. Considering the cyclic core, we find that the discrete point group symmetry not only manifests itself in an anisotropic core shape, but also leads to an orientation-dependent instability, when the vortex line is sufficiently tilted with respect to the orientation of the order parameter. The study of non-Abelian vortex dynamics requires preparation of a vortex pair with noncommuting topolog-ical charges. The order-parameter transformations corresponding to each vortex combine nontrivially, leading to a complicated wave function that is not amenable to conventional imprinting techniques. We propose a two-step protocol to imprint the vortex pair, based on rotating the effective magnetic field between the preparation of each vortex. This allows the imprinting to make use of simple representations of each vortex in a changing spinor basis. We numerically demonstrate the non-Abelian vortex reconnection. The proposed method could be general},

Damped GPE simulations reveal that such OKC states can emerge dynamically, via aggregation of small-scale clusters into giant OKC clusters, as the end states of decaying 2D quantum turbulence in a compressible, finite-temperature superfluid.

   abstract = {We introduce the notion of a quantum version of a discontinuity critical point (DCP) in the context of a first-order quantum phase transition referred to as a quantum DCP (QDCP). We evaluate the critical exponents associated with such a QDCP using the appropriate scaling relations focusing mainly on a QDCP that is located at the boundary between a gapped phase and a gapless critical line as observed in a spin-12 XXZ chain while we also touch upon the conventional Ising case. We then study temporal and spatial quenches in the vicinity of the QDCP associated with the XXZ chain and propose the scaling relation for the defect density and the residual energy characterized by associated critical exponents. These predictions are numerically verified for quenches of the XXZ chain to the QDCP (or across it), thereby establishing the existence of a Kibble-Zurek scaling for such quenches given in terms of appropriate critical exponents. Finally, in the Appendix we consider a generic situation which reduces to the case when the QDCP separates two gapped phases and also to that occurring in the XXZ chain, and present detail analysis of the universality and scaling relations concerning quantum quenches.},

A general analysis of densities at a renormalization-group fixed point demonstrates that if the coexistence of p distinct phases is possible, then p distinct eigenvalue exponents must equal the spatial dimensionality. This basic eigenvalue (or scaling) exponent condition can also be derived phenomenologically by various arguments not depending on detailed renormalization-group considerations. A scaling description of first-order phase transitions is presented and extended to finite systems with linear dimensions L, leading to a rounding proportional to L-d, response-function maxima varying as Ld N, and boundary-condition-dependent shifts which may be as large as L-1. © 1982 The American Physical Society.},

For a quench proceeding at a finite rate the ordering scale is governed by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. The creation of vortices through growth of the magnetization fluctuations is also discussed. The long-time dynamics again depends on the end point, conserving the order parameter in a zero field, but not at a finite field, with differing exponents for the coarsening of magnetic order.

In isolated systems, the heat can be defined as an energy increase due to transitions between distinct energy levels. Across a second-order quantum phase transition (QPT), the heat is predicted theoretically to exhibit a power-law scaling, but it is a significant challenge for an experimental observation. In addition, it remains elusive whether a power-law scaling of heat can exist for a first-order QPT. Here we experimentally observe a power-law scaling of heat in a spinor condensate when a system is linearly driven from a polar phase to an antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase across a first-order QPT. We experimentally evaluate the heat generated during two non-equilibrium processes by probing the atom number on a hyperfine energy level. The experimentally measured scaling exponents agree well with our numerical simulation results. Our work therefore opens a new avenue to experimentally and theoretically exploring the properties of heat in non-equilibrium dynamics.},

The spin-1 system exhibits an energetic hierarchy of length scales resulting from different interaction strengths, and we find that the vortex cores deform to a larger size determined by the characteristic length scale of the spin-dependent interaction. We show that in the ferromagnetic phase the resulting stable core structure, despite apparent complexity, can be identified as a single polar core with an axially symmetric density profile which is nonvanishing everywhere. In the polar phase, the energetically favored core deformation leads to a splitting of a singly quantized vortex into a pair of half-quantum vortices that preserves the topology of the vortex outside the extended core region, but breaks the axial symmetry of the core.

   abstract = {A phase transition describes the sudden change of state of a physical system, such as melting or freezing. Quantum gases provide the opportunity to establish a direct link between experiments and generic models that capture the underlying physics. The Dicke model describes a collective matter–light interaction and has been predicted to show an intriguing quantum phase transition. Here we realize the Dicke quantum phase transition in an open system formed by a Bose–Einstein condensate coupled to an optical cavity, and observe the emergence of a self-organized supersolid phase. The phase transition is driven by infinitely long-range interactions between the condensed atoms, induced by two-photon processes involving the cavity mode and a pump field. We show that the phase transition is described by the Dicke Hamiltonian, including counter-rotating coupling terms, and that the supersolid phase is associated with a spontaneously broken spatial symmetry. The boundary of the phase transition is mapped out in quantitative agreement with the Dicke model. Our results should facilitate studies of quantum gases with long-range interactions and provide access to novel quantum phases. The Dicke model describes a collective interaction between matter and light and has been predicted to show an intriguing quantum phase transition. A team from ETH Zurich now reports the realization of the Dicke quantum phase transition in an open system formed by a Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC) coupled to an optical cavity. The predicted phase transition takes place when light falls on the ultracold rubidium atoms that make up the BEC, but surprisingly the atoms are observed to self-organize into a supersolid phase that exhibits characteristics of both superfluids and solids. This work provides a new model for the study of quantum gases and may also offer access to novel quantum phases. A phase transition occurs when a physical system suddenly changes state, for instance when it melts or freezes. The Dicke model describes a collective matter–light interaction and has been predicted to show a quantum phase transition. Here, this quantum phase transition has been realized in an open system formed by a Bose–Einstein condensate coupled to an optical cavity. Surprisingly, the atoms are observed to self-organize into a supersolid phase.},

   abstract = {We use a quenching scheme to study the dynamics of a one-dimensional anisotropic XY spin-1/2 chain in the presence of a transverse field which alternates between the values h+δ and h-δ from site to site. In this quenching scheme, the parameter denoting the anisotropy of interaction (γ) is linearly quenched from -∞ to +∞ as γ=t/τ, keeping the total strength of interaction J fixed. The system traverses through a gapless phase when γ is quenched along the critical surface h2 = δ2 + J2 in the parameter space spanned by h, δ, and γ. By mapping to an equivalent two-level Landau-Zener problem, we show that the defect density in the final state scales as 1/ τ1/3, a behavior that has not been observed in previous studies of quenching through a gapless phase. We also generalize the model incorporating additional alternations in the anisotropy or in the strength of the interaction and derive an identical result under a similar quenching. Based on the above results, we propose a general scaling of the defect density with the quenching rate τ for quenching along a gapless critical line. © 2008 The American Physical Society.},

These calculations predict that the spinor condensate for the spin-1 boson [Formula Presented] has a ferromagnetic nature. The spinor condensates for the spin-2 bosons [Formula Presented] and [Formula Presented] however, are both predicted to be polar. The nature of a spin-1 condensate hinges critically on the sign of the difference between the s-wave scattering lengths for total spins 0 and 2 while the nature of a spin-2 condensate depends on the values of the differences between s-wave scattering lengths for the total spins 0, 2, and 4. These scattering lengths were extracted previously and found to have overlapping uncertainties for all three cases, thus leaving the nature of the spinor condensates ambiguous. The present study exploits a refined uncertainty analysis of the scattering lengths based on recently improved result from experimental work by Roberts et al., which permits us to extract an unambiguous result for the nature of the ground state spinor condensates. © 2001 The American Physical Society.},

We show that a stable coherent interface is established between the two phases, allowing defects of different topology to connect continuously across the boundary. We provide analytic constructions of interface-crossing defect solutions that could be experimentally phase imprinted using existing technology. By numerically minimizing the energy, we calculate the core structures of interface-crossing defect configurations. We demonstrate nontrivial core deformations to considerably more complex structures, such as the formation of an arch-shaped half-quantum line defect, an Alice arch, at the interface, with the topological charge of a point defect, whose emergence may be understood by the "hairy ball" theorem. Another example of an energetically stable object is the connection of a coreless vortex to a pair of half-quantum vortices. We show that rotation leads to spontaneous nucleation of defects in which a coreless vortex continuously transforms to a half-quantum vortex across the interface. © 2013 American Physical Society.},

In a superfluid obtained through a rapid pressure quench, the phase of the Bose condensate wavefunction—the 4He analogue of the broken symmetry of the field-theoretic vacuum—will be chosen randomly in domains of some characteristic size d. When the quench is performed in an annulus of circumference C the typical value of the phase mismatch around the loop will be ∼(C/d)1/2.
