These triangular lattices contained over 100 vortices with lifetimes of several seconds. Individual vortices persisted up to 40 seconds. The lattices could be generated over a wide range of rotation frequencies and trap geometries, shedding light on the formation process. Our observation of dislocations, irregular structure, and dynamics indicates that gaseous Bose-Einstein condensates may be a model system for the study of vortex matter.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose an efficient and spectrally accurate numerical method for computing the dynamics of rotating Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) in two dimensions (2D) and 3D based on the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) with an angular momentum rotation term. By applying a time-splitting technique for decoupling the nonlinearity and properly using the alternating direction implicit (ADI) technique for the coupling in the angular momentum rotation term in the GPE, at every time step, the GPE in rotational frame is decoupled into a nonlinear ordinary differential equation (ODE) and two partial differential equations with constant coefficients. This allows us to develop new time-splitting spectral (TSSP) methods for computing the dynamics of BEC in a rotational frame. The new numerical method is explicit, unconditionally stable, and of spectral accuracy in space and second order accuracy in time. Moreover, it is time reversible and time transverse invariant, and conserves the position density in the discretized level if the GPE does. Extensive numerical results are presented to confirm the above properties of the new numerical method for rotating BEC in 2D \& 3D.},

  abstract = {TOPOLOGICAL defects in the geometry of space\textendash time (such as cosmic strings) may have played an important role in the evolution of the early Universe, by supplying initial density fluctuations which seeded the clusters of galaxies that we see today1. The formation of cosmic strings during a symmetry-breaking phase transition shortly after the Big Bang is analogous to vortex creation in liquid helium following a rapid transition into the superfluid state; the underlying physics of this cosmological defect-forming process (known as the Kibble mechanism1) should therefore be accessible to experimental study. Superfluid vortices have been observed in 4He following rapid quenching to the superfluid state2, lending qualitative support to Kibble's contention that topological defects are generated by such phase transitions. Here we quantify this process by using an exothermic neutron-induced nuclear reaction to heat small volumes of super-fluid 3He above the superfluid transition temperature, and then measuring the deficit in energy released as these regions of normal liquid pass back into the superfluid state. By ascribing this deficit to the formation of a tangle of vortices, we are able to infer the resulting vortex density; we find that this agrees very well with the predictions of Zurek's modification3 of the original Kibble mechanism1.},

Quantum gases provide the opportunity to establish a direct link between experiments and generic models that capture the underlying physics. The Dicke model describes a collective matter\textendash light interaction and has been predicted to show an intriguing quantum phase transition. Here we realize the Dicke quantum phase transition in an open system formed by a Bose\textendash Einstein condensate coupled to an optical cavity, and observe the emergence of a self-organized supersolid phase. The phase transition is driven by infinitely long-range interactions between the condensed atoms, induced by two-photon processes involving the cavity mode and a pump field. We show that the phase transition is described by the Dicke Hamiltonian, including counter-rotating coupling terms, and that the supersolid phase is associated with a spontaneously broken spatial symmetry. The boundary of the phase transition is mapped out in quantitative agreement with the Dicke model. Our results should facilitate studies of quantum gases with long-range interactions and provide access to novel quantum phases. The Dicke model describes a collective interaction between matter and light and has been predicted to show an intriguing quantum phase transition. A team from ETH Zurich now reports the realization of the Dicke quantum phase transition in an open system formed by a Bose\textendash Einstein condensate (BEC) coupled to an optical cavity. The predicted phase transition takes place when light falls on the ultracold rubidium atoms that make up the BEC, but surprisingly the atoms are observed to self-organize into a supersolid phase that exhibits characteristics of both superfluids and solids. This work provides a new model for the study of quantum gases and may also offer access to novel quantum phases. A phase transition occurs when a physical system suddenly changes state, for instance when it melts or freezes. The Dicke model describes a collective matter\textendash light interaction and has been predicted to show a quantum phase transition. Here, this quantum phase transition has been realized in an open system formed by a Bose\textendash Einstein condensate coupled to an optical cavity. Surprisingly, the atoms are observed to self-organize into a supersolid phase.},

These equations are solved for straight-line vortices. It is demonstrated that the parameters of the equation can be chosen to bring into agreement the vortex core parameter and the healing length. The structure of vortex rings of large radius is studied. The family of the vortex rings of different radii propagating with different velocities is found numerically. As the velocity of the vortex ring reaches the Landau critical velocity the sequence of rings terminates.}

  abstract = {The stability of the axisymmetric solitary waves of the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation is investigated. The implicitly restarted Arnoldi method for banded matrices with shift-invert is used to solve the linearized spectral stability problem. The rarefaction solitary waves on the upper branch of the Jones-Roberts dispersion curve are shown to be unstable to axisymmetric infinitesimal perturbations, whereas the solitary waves on the lower branch and all two-dimensional solitary waves are linearly stable. The growth rates of the instabilities on the upper branch are so small that an arbitrarily specified initial perturbation of a rarefaction wave at first usually evolves towards the upper branch as it acoustically radiates away its excess energy. This is demonstrated through numerical integrations of the GP equation starting from an initial state consisting of an unstable rarefaction wave and random non-axisymmetric noise. The resulting solution evolves towards, and remains for a significant time in the vicinity of, an unperturbed unstable rarefaction wave. It is shown however that, ultimately (or for an initial state extremely close to the upper branch), the solution evolves onto the lower branch or is completely dissipated as sound. It is shown how density depletions in uniform and trapped condensates can generate rarefaction waves, and a simple method is suggested by which such waves can be created in the laboratory.}

We find submicrometre patches of ferromagnetism in a uniform background of paramagnetism, with a non-uniform, weak diamagnetic superconducting susceptibility at low temperature. These results demonstrate the existence of nanoscale phase separation as indicated by theoretical predictions based on nearly degenerate interface sub-bands associated with the Ti orbitals12,13. The magnitude and temperature dependence of the paramagnetic response indicate that the vast majority of the electrons at the interface are localized14, and do not contribute to transport measurements3,6,7. In addition to the implications for magnetism, the existence of a two-dimensional superconductor at an interface with highly broken inversion symmetry and a ferromagnetic landscape in the background indicates the potential for exotic superconducting phenomena.},

Although the topologies of vortices and monopoles are distinct from one another, under certain circumstances a monopole can spontaneously and continuously deform into a vortex ring with the curious property that monopoles passing through it are converted into anti-monopoles. However, the observation of such Alice rings has remained a major challenge, due to the scarcity of experimentally accessible monopoles in continuous fields. Here, we present experimental evidence of an Alice ring resulting from the decay of a topological monopole defect in a dilute gaseous               87               Rb Bose\textendash Einstein condensate. Our results, in agreement with detailed first-principles simulations, provide an unprecedented opportunity to explore the unique features of a composite excitation that combines the topological features of both a monopole and a vortex ring.},

We show that polaritons are characterized by the dynamical critical exponent z{$\approx$}2 with topological defects playing a fundamental role in the dynamics, giving logarithmic corrections both to the power-law decay of the number of vortices and to the associated growth of the characteristic length scale.}

This book, now in its second edition, approaches the problem of quantum phase transitions from a new and unifying perspective. Topics addressed include the concepts of scale and time invariance and their significance for quantum criticality, as well as brand new chapters on superfluid and superconductor quantum critical points, and quantum first order transitions. The renormalisation group in real and momentum space is also established as the proper language to describe the behaviour of systems close to a quantum phase transition. These phenomena introduce a number of theoretical challenges which are of major importance for driving new experiments. Being strongly motivated and oriented towards understanding experimental results, this is an excellent text for graduates, as well as theorists, experimentalists and those with an interest in quantum criticality.},

  abstract = {A simple model is developed to determine a scattering length from the experimental values of the energy of the last, least bound, vibrational levels of the ground state, either or ,of an alkali dimer. It is based on an extrapolation of the positions of the few outermost nodes of the bound vibrational wave functions towards the dissociation threshold. It uses the asymptotic part of the molecular potential only. The method is applied to recently measured levels at the asymptote (3s+3s) of Na2. We obtain precise values for the two scattering lengths respectively associated to the dissociation limits F1=F2=1,F=2 (55.11.6 a0) and F1=F2=1,F=0 (50.01.6 a0); the first value corresponds to the a1,-1 scattering length usually considered in cold collisions. The extrapolation procedure is also applied to Li2, using existing experimental data.},

  abstract = {We discuss the dynamics of a quantum phase transition in a spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate when it is driven from the magnetized broken-symmetry phase to the unmagnetized 'symmetric' polar phase. We determine where the condensate goes out of equilibrium as it approaches the critical point, and compute the condensate magnetization at the critical point. This is done within a quantum Kibble-Zurek scheme traditionally employed in the context of symmetry-breaking quantum phase transitions. Then we study the influence of the non-equilibrium dynamics near a critical point on the condensate magnetization. In particular, when the quench stops at the critical point, nonlinear oscillations of magnetization occur. They are characterized by a period and an amplitude that are inversely proportional. If we keep driving the condensate far away from the critical point through the unmagnetized 'symmetric' polar phase, the amplitude of magnetization oscillations slowly decreases reaching a nonzero asymptotic value. That process is described by an equation that can be mapped onto the classical mechanical problem of a particle moving under the influence of harmonic and 'anti-friction' forces whose interplay leads to surprisingly simple fixed-amplitude oscillations. We obtain several scaling results relating the condensate magnetization to the quench rate, and verify numerically all analytical predictions. \textcopyright{} IOP Publishing Ltd and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.}

This enforces a local choice of the broken symmetry and can lead to the formation of topological defects. The Kibble\textendash Zurek mechanism (KZM) was developed to describe the associated nonequilibrium dynamics and to estimate the density of defects as a function of the quench rate through the transition. During recent years, several new experiments investigated the formation of defects in phase transitions induced by a quench both in classical and quantum mechanical systems. At the same time, some established results were called into question. We review and analyze the Kibble\textendash Zurek mechanism focusing in particular on this surge of activity, and suggest possible directions for further progress.},

Since electric charges are known to be quantized and no reason for this has yet been proposed apart from the existence of magnetic poles, we have here a reason for taking magnetic poles seriously. The fact that they have not yet been observed may be ascribed to the large value of the quantum of pole. In 1931 I gave a primitive theory which described the motion of a pole in the field of a charged particle whose motion is given, or the motion of a charged particle in the field of a pole whose motion is given. The present paper sets up a general theory of charged particles and poles in interaction through the medium of the electromagnetic field. The idea which makes this generalization possible consists in supposing each pole to be at the end of an observable string, which is the line along which the electromagnetic potentials are singular, and introducing dynamical coordinates and momenta to describe the motion of the strings. The whole theory then comes out by the application of standard methods. There are unsolved difficulties, concerned with the interaction of a point charge or a point pole with the field it produces itself, such as occur in all dynamical theories of fields and particles in interaction. \textcopyright{} 1948 The American Physical Society.}

This inflationary scenario is natural in the brane world picture. In the lowest energy state, a number of branes sit on top of each other (or at an orientifold plane), so the vacuum energy cancels out. In the cosmological setting, some of the branes "start out" relatively displaced in the extra dimensions and the resulting vacuum energy triggers the exponential growth of the 3 non-compact dimensions. The number of e-foldings can be very large due to the very weak brane-brane interaction at large distances. In the effective four-dimensional field theory, the brane motion is described by a slowly rolling scalar field with an extremely flat plateau potential. When branes approach each other to a critical distance, the potential becomes steep and inflation ends rapidly. Then the branes "collide" and oscillate about the equilibrium point, releasing energy mostly into radiation on the branes. In this scenario, it is even possible for the electroweak Higgs field to be the inflaton. \textcopyright{} 1999 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}

  abstract = {Abstract             Dense quantum chromodynamic matter accommodates various kind of topological solitons such as vortices, domain walls, monopoles, kinks, boojums, and so on. In this review, we discuss various properties of topological solitons in dense quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and their phenomenological implications. Particular emphasis is placed on the topological solitons in the color\textendash flavor-locked (CFL) phase, which exhibits both superfluidity and superconductivity. The properties of topological solitons are discussed in terms of effective field theories such as the Ginzburg\textendash Landau theory, the chiral Lagrangian, or the Bogoliubov\textendash de Gennes equation. The most fundamental string-like topological excitations in the CFL phase are non-Abelian vortices, which are 1/3 quantized superfluid vortices and color magnetic flux tubes. These vortices are created at a phase transition by the Kibble\textendash Zurek mechanism or when the CFL phase is realized in compact stars, which rotate rapidly. The interaction between vortices is found to be repulsive and consequently a vortex lattice is formed in rotating CFL matter. Bosonic and fermionic zero-energy modes are trapped in the core of a non-Abelian vortex and propagate along it as gapless excitations. The former consists of translational zero modes (a Kelvin mode) with a quadratic dispersion and \$\{\textbackslash mathbb \{C\}\}P\^2\$ Nambu\textendash Goldstone gapless modes with a linear dispersion, associated with the CFL symmetry spontaneously broken in the core of a vortex, while the latter is Majorana fermion zero modes belonging to the triplet of the symmetry remaining in the core of a vortex. The low-energy effective theory of the bosonic zero modes is constructed as a non-relativistic free complex scalar field and a relativistic \$\{\textbackslash mathbb \{C\}\}P\^2\$ model in 1+1 dimensions. The effects of strange quark mass, electromagnetic interactions, and non-perturbative quantum corrections are taken into account in the \$\{\textbackslash mathbb \{C\}\}P\^2\$ effective theory. Various topological objects associated with non-Abelian vortices are studied; colorful boojums at the CFL interface, the quantum color magnetic monopole confined by vortices, which supports the notion of quark\textendash hadron duality, and Yang\textendash Mills instantons inside a non-Abelian vortex as lumps are discussed. The interactions between a non-Abelian vortex and quasiparticles such as phonons, gluons, mesons, and photons are studied. As a consequence of the interaction with photons, a vortex lattice behaves as a cosmic polarizer. As a remarkable consequence of Majorana fermion zero modes, non-Abelian vortices are shown to behave as a novel kind of non-Abelian anyon. In the order parameters of chiral symmetry breaking, we discuss fractional and integer axial domain walls, Abelian and non-Abelian axial vortices, axial wall\textendash vortex composites, and Skyrmions.},

The critical temperature agrees with the theoretical prediction for a uniform Bose gas. The momentum distribution of a noncondensed quantum-degenerate gas is also clearly distinct from the conventional case of a harmonically trapped sample and close to the expected distribution in a uniform system. We confirm the coherence of our condensate in a matter-wave interference experiment. Our experiments open many new possibilities for fundamental studies of many-body physics.},

We demonstrate that the clusters persist for long time periods, maintaining the superfluid system in a high-energy state far from global equilibrium. Our experiments explore a regime of vortex matter at negative absolute temperatures and have relevance for the dynamics of topological defects, two-dimensional turbulence, and systems such as helium films, nonlinear optical materials, fermion superfluids, and quark-gluon plasmas.}

As a simple illustration of dynamics, we show that the technique can transform a toroidal condensate into a ring lattice and back into a toroid.

Tiny inhomogeneities in the mix of particles and radiation produced in the Big Bang grew into the clusters of galaxies that we see today, but how those inhomogeneities arose and grew is still unclear. Cosmologies based on grand unified theories suggest that a symmetry-breaking phase transition occurred via the Higgs mechanism about 10-34 after the Big Bang as the Universe cooled through a critical temperature of 1027 K. It has been proposed by Kibble1 that this transition may have generated defects in the geometry of space-time (such as cosmic strings), which provided the inhomogeneities on which galaxies subsequently condensed. Zurek2\textendash 4 has suggested that it might be possible to model this cosmological phase transition by a laboratory analogue, the superfluid transition of liquid 4He induced by fast adiabatic expansion through the critical density. Here we report the results of such an experiment. We observe copious production of quantized vortices5, the superfluid analogue of cosmic strings. These results support Kibble's contention that such defects were available in the early Universe to seed galaxy formation.},

For different protocols, we demonstrate dynamical scaling in the non-adiabatic time window and provide analytic and numerical evidence for specific scaling properties of various quantities. In particular, we argue that the higher cumulants of the excess heat exhibit universal scaling in generic interacting models for a slow enough ramp.}

We observed signatures of an inverse energy cascade driven by the evaporative heating of vortices, leading to steady-state configurations characterized by negative absolute temperatures. Our results open a pathway for quantitative studies of emergent structures in interacting quantum systems driven far from equilibrium.},

  abstract = {In a two-dimensional (2D) turbulent fluid containing point-like vortices, Lars Onsager predicted that adding energy to the fluid can lead to the formation of persistent clusters of like-signed vortices, i.e., Onsager vortex (OV) clusters. In the evolution of 2D superfluid turbulence in a uniform disk-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), it was discovered that a pair of OV clusters with opposite signs can form without any energy input. This striking spontaneous order was explained as due to a vortex evaporative-heating mechanism, i.e., annihilations of vortex-antivortex pairs which remove the lowest-energy vortices and thereby boost the mean energy per vortex. However, in our search for exotic OV states in a boundaryless 2D spherical BEC, we found that OV clusters never form despite the annihilations of vortex pairs. Our analysis reveals that contrary to the general belief, vortex-pair annihilation emits intense sound waves, which damp the motion of all vortices and hence suppress the formation of OV clusters. We also present unequivocal evidences showing that the true mechanism underlying the observed spontaneous OV state is the escaping of vortices from the BEC boundary. Uncovering this mechanism paves the way for a comprehensive understanding of emergent vortex orders in 2D manifolds of superfluids driven far from equilibrium.}

A spinor condensate is initially prepared in the easy-plane polar phase, and then, suddenly quenched into the easy-axis polar phase. Domain walls are created via the spontaneous Z2 symmetry breaking in the phase transition and the walls dynamically split into composite defects due to snake instability. The end points of the defects are identified as HQVs for the polar order parameter and the mass supercurrent in their proximity is demonstrated using Bragg scattering. In a strong quench regime, we observe that singly charged quantum vortices are formed with the relaxation of free wall-vortex composite defects. Our results demonstrate a nucleation mechanism for composite defects via phase transition dynamics.},

First, we review the fundamental structure, stability and dynamics of a single vortex state in a slowly rotating two-component condensates. To understand recent experimental results, we use the coupled Gross\textendash Pitaevskii equations and the generalized nonlinear sigma model. An axisymmetric vortex state, which was observed by the JILA group, can be regarded as a topologically trivial skyrmion in the pseudospin representation. The internal, coherent coupling between the two components breaks the axisymmetry of the vortex state, resulting in a stable vortex molecule (a meron pair). We also mention unconventional vortex states and monopole excitations in a spin-1 Bose\textendash Einstein condensate. Next, we discuss a rich variety of vortex states realized in rapidly rotating two-component Bose\textendash Einstein condensates. We introduce a phase diagram with axes of rotation frequency and the intercomponent coupling strength. This phase diagram reveals unconventional vortex states such as a square lattice, a double-core lattice, vortex stripes and vortex sheets, all of which are in an experimentally accessible parameter regime. The coherent coupling leads to an effective attractive interaction between two components, providing not only a promising candidate to tune the intercomponent interaction to study the rich vortex phases but also a new regime to explore vortex states consisting of vortex molecules characterized by anisotropic vorticity. A recent experiment by the JILA group vindicated the formation of a square vortex lattice in this system.},

  abstract = {Topological excitations are usually classified by the nth homotopy group {$\pi$}n. However, for topological excitations that coexist with vortices, there are cases in which an element of {$\pi$}n cannot properly describe the charge of a topological excitation due to the influence of the vortices. This is because an element of {$\pi$}n corresponding to the charge of a topological excitation may change when the topological excitation circumnavigates a vortex. This phenomenon is referred to as the action of {$\pi$}1 on {$\pi$}n. In this paper, we show that topological excitations coexisting with vortices are classified by the Abe homotopy group {$\kappa$}n. The nth Abe homotopy group {$\kappa$}n is defined as a semi-direct product of {$\pi$}1 and {$\pi$}n. In this framework, the action of {$\pi$}1 on {$\pi$}n is understood as originating from noncommutativity between {$\pi$}1 and {$\pi$}n. We show that a physical charge of a topological excitation can be described in terms of the conjugacy class of the Abe homotopy group. Moreover, the Abe homotopy group naturally describes vortex-pair creation and annihilation processes, which also influence topological excitations. We calculate the influence of vortices on topological excitations for the case in which the order parameter manifold is Sn/K, where Sn is an n-dimensional sphere and K is a discrete subgroup of SO(n+1). We show that the influence of vortices on a topological excitation exists only if n is even and K includes a nontrivial element of O(n)/SO(n).},

The structures evolve within a quasi-one-dimensional BEC of Rb87 atoms on length scales of a millimeter with typical periodicities of 20...30{$\mu$}m, given by the spin healing length. We observe two sets of characteristic patterns which can be controlled by an external magnetic field. We identify these patterns as linearly unstable modes within a mean-field approach and calculate their mode structure as well as time and energy scales, which we find to be in good agreement with observations. These investigations open new prospects for controlled studies of symmetry breaking and complex quantum magnetism in bulk BEC. \textcopyright{} 2010 The American Physical Society.}

  abstract = {Distinguishing whether a system supports alternate low-energy (locally stable) states -- stable (true vacuum) versus metastable (false vacuum) -- by direct observation can be difficult when the lifetime of the state is very long but otherwise unknown. Here we demonstrate, in a tractable model system, that there are physical phenomena on much shorter time scales that can diagnose the difference. Specifically, we study the spectral density following a quench in the tilted quantum Ising model, and show that the evolution of the spectral density is a powerful diagnostic. Small transition bubbles are more common than large ones, and we see characteristic differences in the size dependence of bubble lifetimes even well below the critical size for false vacuum decay. We expect this sort of behavior to be generic in systems of this kind. We identify a scaling limit that connects the discrete, simulatable model to continuum quantum field theory.},

Here we report on the spontaneous creation of solitons in Bose-Einstein condensates through the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. We measure the power-law dependence of defect number on the quench time, and show that lower atomic densities enhance defect formation.

By controlling s-wave scattering lengths and the coupling strength, it is possible to stimulate SBTs between normal and spontaneously polarized ground states. In static transitions, the probability maxima of full quantum ground states correspond to the mean-field ground states. In dynamical transitions, due to the vanishing of excitation gaps, the mean-field dynamics shows universal scalings obeying the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Both mean-field and full quantum defect modes appear as damped oscillations, but they appear at different critical points and undergo different oscillation regimes. The anomalous breakdown of mean-field dynamics induced by SBTs depends on the approaching direction. \textcopyright{} 2009 The American Physical Society.}

Quantum simulations of electromagnetic forces have the potential to provide information about materials and systems that do not have conveniently solvable theoretical descriptions, such as those related to quantum Hall physics, or that have not been physically observed, such as magnetic monopoles. However, quantum simulations that simultaneously implement all of the principal features of classical electromagnetism have thus far proved elusive. We experimentally realize a simulation in which a charged quantum particle interacts with the knotted electromagnetic fields peculiar to a topological model of ball lightning. These phenomena are induced by precise spatiotemporal control of the spin field of an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate, simultaneously creating a Shankar skyrmion\textemdash a topological excitation that was theoretically predicted four decades ago but never before observed experimentally.

In isolated systems, the heat can be defined as an energy increase due to transitions between distinct energy levels. Across a second-order quantum phase transition (QPT), the heat is predicted theoretically to exhibit a power-law scaling, but it is a significant challenge for an experimental observation. In addition, it remains elusive whether a power-law scaling of heat can exist for a first-order QPT. Here we experimentally observe a power-law scaling of heat in a spinor condensate when a system is linearly driven from a polar phase to an antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase across a first-order QPT. We experimentally evaluate the heat generated during two non-equilibrium processes by probing the atom number on a hyperfine energy level. The experimentally measured scaling exponents agree well with our numerical simulation results. Our work therefore opens a new avenue to experimentally and theoretically exploring the properties of heat in non-equilibrium dynamics.},

For all larger p , there are two possible energy states. One (the lower branch) is (for large enough p) a vortex ring of circulation K ; as p + m its radius G-(\textasciitilde{} / T K) " * becomes infinite and its forward velocity tends to zero. The other (the upper branch) lacks vorticity and is a rarefaction sound pulse that becomes increasingly one dimensional as p +a; its velocity approaches c for large p. The velocity of any member of the family is shown, both numerically and analytically, to be aE/ap, the derivative being taken along the family. At great distances, the disturbance in the condensate is pseudo-dipolar (dipolar in a stretched coordinate system); the strength of the pseudo-dipole moment is obtained numerically. Analogous calculations are presented for the corresponding two-dimensional problem. Again, a continuous sequence of solitary waves is obtained, but the momentum per unit length p and energy per unit length E have no minima. For small forward velocities, the wave consists of two widely separated parallel, oppositely directed line vortices. As the forward velocity increases the wave loses its vorticity and becomes a rarefaction pulse of ever increasing spatial extent but ever decreasing amplitude. As its velocity approaches c, both p and E tend to zero, and Elp + c.}

During such crossing, the system breaks its symmetry by establishing numerous uncorrelated regions separated by spontaneously generated defects, whose emergence obeys a universal scaling law with quench duration. The ensuing re-equilibrating or ``coarse-graining'' stage is governed by the evolution and interactions of such defects under system-specific and external constraints. We perform a detailed numerical characterisation of the entire non-equilibrium process associated with the Bose\textendash Einstein condensation phase transition in a three-dimensional gas of ultracold atoms, addressing subtle issues and demonstrating the quench-induced decoupling of condensate atom number and coherence growth during the re-equilibration process. Our findings agree, in a statistical sense, with experimental observations made at the later stages of the quench, and provide valuable information and useful dynamical visualisations in currently experimentally inaccessible regimes.},

  abstract = {Antiferromagnetic condensates are generally believed not to display modulational instability and subsequent spin-domain formation. Here we demonstrate that in the presence of a homogeneous magnetic field antiferromagnetic spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates can undergo spatial modulational instability followed by the subsequent generation of spin domains. Employing numerical simulations for realistic conditions, we show how this effect can be observed in sodium condensates confined in an optical trap. Finally, we link this instability and spin-domain formation with stationary modes of the condensate. \textcopyright{} 2008 The American Physical Society.}

The system exhibits two different critical behaviors corresponding to transitions from polar to broken-axisymmetry and from antiferromagnetic to broken-axisymmetry phases, depending on the value of the magnetization. We exploit both types of system criticality as a resource in the precise estimation of the control parameter value. We quantify the achievable precision by the quantum Fisher information. We demonstrate supersensitivity and show that the precision scales with the number of atoms up to N4 around criticality. In addition, we study the precision based on the error-propagation formula, which provides a simple-to-measure signal whose scaling coincides with the quantum Fisher information. Finally, we take into account the effect of nonzero temperature and show that sub-shot-noise sensitivity in the estimation of the control parameter is achievable in the low-temperature limit.}

Here we perform such a measurement for a direct energy cascade in a turbulent quantum gas. Using a time-periodic force, we inject energy at a large length scale and generate a cascade in a uniformly trapped three-dimensional Bose gas. The adjustable trap depth provides a high-momentum cutoff kD, which realizes a synthetic dissipation scale. This gives us direct access to the particle flux across a momentum shell of radius kD, and the tunability of kD allows for a clear demonstration of the zeroth law of turbulence. Moreover, our time-resolved measurements give unique access to the pre\textendash steady-state dynamics, when the cascade front propagates in momentum space.},

By controlling the flow velocity we determine the critical velocity for the nucleation of a single vortex dipole, with excellent agreement between experimental and numerical results.

For sufficiently rapid flow velocities, clusters of like-charge vortices aggregate into long-lived multiply charged dipolar flow structures.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Analogies between non-trivial topologies of matter and light have inspired numerous studies, including defect formation in structured light and topological photonic band structures. Three-dimensional topological objects of localised particle-like nature attract broad interest across discipline boundaries from elementary particle physics and cosmology to condensed matter physics. Here we propose how simple structured light beams can be transformed into optical excitations of atoms with considerably more complex topologies representing three-dimensional particle-like Skyrmions. This construction can also be described in terms of linked Hopf maps, analogous to knotted solitons of the Skyrme-Faddeev model. We identify the transverse polarisation density current as the effective magnetic gauge potential for the Chern-Simons helicity term. While we prepare simpler two-dimensional baby-Skyrmions and singular defects using the traditional Stokes vectors on the Poincar\'e sphere for light, particle-like topologies can only be achieved in the full optical hypersphere description that no longer discards the variation of the total electromagnetic phase of vibration.},

  abstract = {Predicting the dynamics of quantum systems far from equilibrium represents one of the most challenging problems in theoretical many-body physics1,2. While the evolution of a many-body system is in general intractable in all its details, relevant observables can become insensitive to microscopic system parameters and initial conditions. This is the basis of the phenomenon of universality. Far from equilibrium, universality is identified through the scaling of the spatio-temporal evolution of the system, captured by universal exponents and functions. Theoretically, this has been studied in examples as different as the reheating process in inflationary Universe cosmology3,4, the dynamics of nuclear collision experiments described by quantum chromodynamics5,6, and the post-quench dynamics in dilute quantum gases in non-relativistic quantum field theory7\textendash 11. However, an experimental demonstration of such scaling evolution in space and time in a quantum many-body system has been lacking. Here we observe the emergence of universal dynamics by evaluating spatially resolved spin correlations in a quasi-one-dimensional spinor Bose\textendash Einstein condensate12\textendash 16. For long evolution times we extract the scaling properties from the spatial correlations of the spin excitations. From this we find the dynamics to be governed by an emergent conserved quantity\&nbsp;and the transport of spin excitations towards low momentum scales. Our results establish an important class of non-stationary systems whose dynamics is encoded in time-independent scaling exponents and functions, signalling the existence of non-thermal fixed points10,17,18. We confirm that the non-thermal scaling phenomenon involves no fine-tuning\&nbsp;of parameters, by preparing different initial conditions and observing the same scaling behaviour. Our analogue quantum simulation approach provides the basis with which to reveal the underlying mechanisms and characteristics of non-thermal universality classes. One may use this universality to learn, from experiments with ultracold gases, about fundamental aspects of dynamics studied in cosmology and quantum chromodynamics. The emergence of universal dynamics far from equilibrium is observed by evaluating spatially resolved spin correlations in a quasi-one-dimensional spinor Bose\textendash Einstein condensate.},

However, for first-order quantum phase transitions, the Kibble-Zurek mechanism is usually not applicable. Here, we experimentally demonstrate and theoretically analyze a power-law scaling in the dynamics of a spin-1 condensate across a first-order quantum phase transition when a system is slowly driven from a polar phase to an antiferromagnetic phase. We show that this power-law scaling can be described by a generalized Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Furthermore, by experimentally measuring the spin population, we show the power-law scaling of the temporal onset of spin excitations with respect to the quench rate, which agrees well with our numerical simulation results. Our results open the door for further exploring the generalized Kibble-Zurek mechanism to understand the dynamics across first-order quantum phase transitions.},

In this work we show theoretically that the coherent vortex structures that emerge in decaying 2D quantum turbulence can approach quasiclassical rigid-body rotation, obeying the Feynman rule of constant average areal vortex density while remaining spatially disordered. By developing a rigorous link between the velocity probability distribution and the quantum kinetic energy spectrum over wave number k, we show that the coherent vortex structures are associated with a k3 power law in the infrared region of the spectrum, and a well-defined spectral peak that is a physical manifestation of the largest structures. We discuss the possibility of realizing coherent structures in Bose-Einstein condensate experiments and present Gross-Pitaevskii simulations showing that this phenomenon, and its associated spectral signatures, can emerge dynamically from feasible initial vortex configurations. \textcopyright{} 2014 American Physical Society.}

Here we report the results of an experiment in which the 'primordial fireball' is mimicked using a neutron-induced nuclear reaction (n + 3He \textrightarrow{} p + 3He + 0.76 MeV) to heat small regions of superfluid 3He above the superfluid transition temperature. These bubbles of normal liquid cool extremely rapidly, and we find that their transition back to the superfluid state is accompanied by the formation of a random network of vortices (the superfluid analogue of cosmic strings). We monitor the evolution of this defect state by rotating the superfluid sample, allowing vortices to escape from the network and thus be probed individually. Our results provide clear confirmation of the idea that topological defects form at a rapid second-order phase transition, and give quantitative support to the Kibble\textendash Zurek mechanism5,6 of cosmological defect formation.},

The flow persists without decay for up to 10 s, limited only by experimental factors such as drift and trap lifetime. The quantized rotation was initiated by transferring one unit of the orbital angular momentum from Laguerre-Gaussian photons to each atom. Stable flow was only possible when the trap was multiply connected, and was observed with a Bose-Einstein condensate fraction as small as 20\%. We also created flow with two units of angular momentum and observed its splitting into two singly charged vortices when the trap geometry was changed from multiply to simply connected.},

The formation of ferromagnetic domains and domain walls is observed, and spin vortices (containing non-zero spin current but no net mass current) detected in situ. A central goal in condensed matter and modern atomic physics is the exploration of quantum phases of matter\textemdash in particular, how the universal characteristics of zero-temperature quantum phase transitions differ from those established for thermal phase transitions at non-zero temperature. Compared to conventional condensed matter systems, atomic gases provide a unique opportunity to explore quantum dynamics far from equilibrium. For example, gaseous spinor Bose\textendash Einstein condensates1,2,3 (whose atoms have non-zero internal angular momentum) are quantum fluids that simultaneously realize superfluidity and magnetism, both of which are associated with symmetry breaking. Here we explore spontaneous symmetry breaking in 87Rb spinor condensates, rapidly quenched across a quantum phase transition to a ferromagnetic state. We observe the formation of spin textures, ferromagnetic domains and domain walls, and demonstrate phase-sensitive in situ detection of spin vortices. The latter are topological defects resulting from the symmetry breaking, containing non-zero spin current but no net mass current4.},

We show that the subsystem of vortex gas excitations results in the spontaneous emergence of a coherent superfluid flow with a nonzero coarse-grained vorticity field. The stream function of this emergent quasiclassical 2D flow is governed by a Poisson-Boltzmann equation. This equation reveals that maximum entropy states of a neutral vortex gas that describe the spectral condensation of energy can be classified into types of flow depending on whether or not the flow spontaneously acquires angular momentum. Numerical simulations of a neutral point vortex model and a Bose gas governed by the 2D Gross-Pitaevskii equation in a square reveal that a large-scale monopole flow field with net angular momentum emerges that is consistent with predictions of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation. The results allow us to characterize the spectral energy condensate in a 2D quantum fluid that bears striking similarity to similar flows observed in experiments of 2D classical turbulence. By deforming the square into a rectangular region, the resulting maximum entropy state switches to a dipolar flow field with zero net angular momentum.}

  abstract = {Abstract                            In a two-dimensional (2D) classical fluid, a large-scale flow structure emerges out of turbulence, which is known as the inverse energy cascade where energy flows from small to large length scales. An interesting question is whether this phenomenon can occur in a superfluid, which is inviscid and irrotational by nature. Atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) of highly oblate geometry provide an experimental venue for studying 2D superfluid turbulence, but their full investigation has been hindered due to a lack of the circulation sign information of individual quantum vortices in a turbulent sample. Here, we demonstrate a vortex sign detection method by using Bragg scattering, and we investigate decaying turbulence in a highly oblate BEC at low temperatures, with our lowest being \textasciitilde 0.5               T                                c                              , where               T                                c                              is the superfluid critical temperature. We observe that weak spatial pairing between vortices and antivortices develops in the turbulent BEC, which corresponds to the vortex-dipole gas regime predicted for high dissipation. Our results provide a direct quantitative marker for the survey of various 2D turbulence regimes in the BEC system.},

  abstract = {A unified field theory of mesons and their particle sources is proposed and considered in its classical aspects. The theory has static solutions of a singular nature, but finite energy,characterized by spin directions; the number of such entities is a rigorously conserved constant of motion; they interact with an external meson field through a derivative-type coupling with the spins, akin to the formalism of strong-coupling meson theory. There is a conserved current identifiable with isobaric spin, and another that may be related to hyper-charge. The postulates include one constant of the dimensions of length, and another that is conjectured necessarily to have the value               \cyrchar\cyrdje c               , or perhaps {$\frac{1}{2}$}               \cyrchar\cyrdje c               , in the quantized theory.},

  abstract = {A quantum system can undergo a continuous phase transition at the absolute zero of temperature as some parameter entering its Hamiltonian is varied. These transitions are particularly interesting for, in contrast to their classical finite-temperature counterparts, their dynamic and static critical behaviors are intimately intertwined. Considerable insight is gained by considering the path-integral description of the quantum statistical mechanics of such systems, which takes the form of the classical statistical mechanics of a system in which time appears as an extra dimension. In particular, this allows the deduction of scaling forms for the finite-temperature behavior, which turns out to be described by the theory of finite-size scaling. It also leads naturally to the notion of a temperature-dependent dephasing length that governs the crossover between quantum and classical fluctuations. Using these ideas, a scaling analysis of experiments on Josephson-junction arrays and quantum-Hall-effect systems is presented.},

We simulate the phase-transition dynamics by using a classical field method with noisy initial conditions and find good agreement with the experimental observations. We analyze the late-time dynamics in terms of phase ordering by using the nematic order parameter that we have developed in earlier work [Phys. Rev.

In the presence of surface-induced disorder the correlation lengths, parallel and perpendicular to the surface, diverge at the bulk transition point. In this way the surface induces an anisotropic power-law singular behavior for some bulk quantities. For example, in a finite system of transverse linear size L, the response functions diverge as L(d-1)z+1, where d is the dimension of the system and z is the anisotropy exponent. We present a general scaling picture for this anisotropic discontinuity fixed point. Our phenomenological results are confronted with analytical and numerical calculations on the two-dimensional q-state Potts model in the large-q limit. The scaling results are demonstrated to apply also for the same model with a layered, Fibonacci-type modulation of the couplings for which the anisotropy exponent is a continuous function of the strength of the quasiperiodic perturbation.},

Power-law distributions of simulated glitch sizes are obtained, in accord with astronomical observations, with exponents ranging from -0.55 to -1.26. Examples of large-scale simulations, containing {$\sim$}200 vortices, reveal that these statistics persist in the many-vortex limit. Waiting-time distributions are also constructed. These and other statistics support the hypothesis that catastrophic unpinning mediated by collective vortex motion produces glitches; indeed, such collective events are seen in time-lapse movies of superfluid density. Three principal trends are observed. (1) The glitch rate scales proportional to the electromagnetic spin-down torque. (2) A strong positive correlation is found between the strength of vortex pinning and mean glitch size. (3) The spin-down dynamics depend less on the pinning site abundance once the latter exceeds one site per vortex, suggesting that unpinned vortices travel a distance comparable to the intervortex spacing before repinning.},

  abstract = {Phase transitions are ubiquitous in nature, and can be arranged into universality classes such that systems having unrelated microscopic physics show identical scaling behaviour near the critical point. One prominent universal element of many continuous phase transitions is the spontaneous formation of topological defects during a quench through the critical point. The microscopic dynamics of defect formation in such transitions are generally difficult to investigate, particularly for superfluids. However, Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) offer unique experimental and theoretical opportunities for probing these details. Here we present an experimental and theoretical study of the BEC phase transition of a trapped atomic gas, in which we observe and statistically characterize the spontaneous formation of vortices during condensation. Using microscopic theories that incorporate atomic interactions and quantum and thermal fluctuations of a finite-temperature Bose gas, we simulate condensation and observe vortex formation in close quantitative agreement with our experimental results. Our studies provide further understanding of the development of coherence in superfluids, and may allow for direct investigation of universal phase transition dynamics. \textcopyright 2008 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Among the most fascinating examples are the singular vortices arising from the rotational symmetry group SO(3), with surprising topological properties illustrated by Dirac's famous belt trick. Despite considerable interest, controlled preparation and detailed study of vortex lines with complex internal structure in fully three-dimensional spinor systems remains an outstanding experimental challenge. Here, we propose and implement a reproducible and controllable method for creating and detecting a singular SO(3) line vortex from the decay of a non-singular spin texture in a ferromagnetic spin-1 Bose\textendash Einstein condensate. Our experiment explicitly demonstrates the SO(3) character and the unique spinor properties of the defect. Although the vortex is singular, its core fills with atoms in the topologically distinct polar magnetic phase. The resulting stable, coherent topological interface has analogues in systems ranging from condensed matter to cosmology and string theory.},

We deduce differences in scattering lengths from our data that can directly be compared to theoretical predictions in order to test interatomic potentials. Our measurements agree with the predictions within 20\%. The knowledge of these coupling parameters allows one to determine the nature of the magnetic ground state. Our data imply a ferromagnetic ground state for 87Rb in the f = 1 manifold, in agreement with earlier experiments performed without the optical lattice. For 87Rb in the f = 2 manifold, the data point towards an antiferromagnetic ground state; however our error bars do not exclude a possible cyclic phase.},

For a purely transversely magnetized system, the Turner point-vortex model predicts that PCVs behave like massive charged particles interacting via a two-dimensional Coulomb potential. We test the accuracy of the Turner model for two oppositely charged PCVs, via comparisons with numerical simulations. While the bare Turner model shows discrepancies with our numerical results, we find that a simple rescaling of the PCV mass gives much better agreement. This can be explained via a phenomenological damping arising from coupling to modes extrinsic to the point-vortex phase space. We also identify the excitations produced following PCV annihilation, which help elucidate recent phase ordering results. We extend the Turner model to cases where the system is magnetized both transversally and axially, identifying a crossover to scalar vortex dynamics for increasing external Zeeman field.}

  abstract = {We review some recent results on discrete symmetries and topological order in spinor Bose\textendash Einstein condensates (BECs) of               23               Na. For spin one bosons with two-body scatterings dominated by a total spin equal to two channel, the BECs are in quantum spin nematic states at a low density limit. We study spin correlations in condensates at different limits and analyze hidden symmetries using a non-perturbative approach developed recently. Furthermore we investigate the influence of hidden Z               2               symmetries and U(1) quantum orders in symmetry partially restored states, particularly the effects on topological excitations.},

  abstract = {Large spin systems can exhibit unconventional types of magnetic ordering, different from the ferromagnetic or N\'eel-like antiferromagnetic order commonly found in spin 1/2 systems. Spin-nematic phases, for instance, do not break time-reversal invariance, and their magnetic order parameter is characterized by a second-rank tensor with the symmetry of an ellipsoid. Here we show direct experimental evidence of spin-nematic ordering in a spin 1 Bose-Einstein condensate of sodium atoms with antiferromagnetic interactions. In a mean field description this order is enforced by locking the relative phase between spin components. We reveal this mechanism by studying the spin noise after a spin rotation, which is shown to contain information hidden when looking only at averages. The method should be applicable to high-spin systems in order to reveal complex magnetic phases.}

Here I discuss the analogy between cosmological strings and vortex lines in the superfluid, and suggest a cryogenic experiment which tests key elements of the cosmological scenario for string formation. In a superfluid obtained through a rapid pressure quench, the phase of the Bose condensate wavefunction\textemdash the 4He analogue of the broken symmetry of the field-theoretic vacuum\textemdash will be chosen randomly in domains of some characteristic size d. When the quench is performed in an annulus of circumference C the typical value of the phase mismatch around the loop will be {$\sim$}(C/d)1/2. The resulting phase gradient can foe sufficiently large to cause the superfluid to flow with a measurable (mm s-1), randomly directed velocity.},

  abstract = {Superfluid phase transition in He\$\^4\$ can be accomplished through pressure quench on a short (dynamical) timescale. ``Vacuum condensate'' of the new, broken symmetry phase is the wavefunction of the superfluid Bose condensate with a certain ``trapped'' distribution of vortex lines. Analogous phase transitions from the false to the true vacuum are expected to occur in the early universe. There they are thought to leave behind topological defects such as strings. I calculate the density of strings (\{\textbackslash it i.e.\}, vortex lines) predicted by the application of the cosmological scenario to He\$\^4\$. The proposed experiment tests key elements of the standard cosmological scenario for creation of topological defects --- known as the Kibble mechanism --- in a cryogenic setting. Analogous experiments can be performed in superconductors as well as in either phase of He\$\^3\$, and have been already carried out by Yurke and his co-workers in liquid crystals.}
