These triangular lattices contained over 100 vortices with lifetimes of several seconds. Individual vortices persisted up to 40 seconds. The lattices could be generated over a wide range of rotation frequencies and trap geometries, shedding light on the formation process. Our observation of dislocations, irregular structure, and dynamics indicates that gaseous Bose-Einstein condensates may be a model system for the study of vortex matter.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

In the phase segregated regime, we find that there are two distinct phases: the weakly segregated phase characterized by a ``penetration depth'' and the strongly segregated phase characterized by a healing length. In the weakly segregated phase the symmetry of the shape of each condensate will not take that of the trap because of the finite surface tension, but its total density profile still does. In the strongly segregated phase even the total density profile takes a different symmetry from that of the trap because of the mutual exclusion of the condensates. The lower critical condensate-atom number to observe the complete phase segregation is discussed. A comparison to recent experimental data suggests that the weakly segregated phase has been observed. \textcopyright{} 1998 The American Physical Society.}

By applying a time-splitting technique for decoupling the nonlinearity and properly using the alternating direction implicit (ADI) technique for the coupling in the angular momentum rotation term in the GPE, at every time step, the GPE in rotational frame is decoupled into a nonlinear ordinary differential equation (ODE) and two partial differential equations with constant coefficients. This allows us to develop new time-splitting spectral (TSSP) methods for computing the dynamics of BEC in a rotational frame. The new numerical method is explicit, unconditionally stable, and of spectral accuracy in space and second order accuracy in time. Moreover, it is time reversible and time transverse invariant, and conserves the position density in the discretized level if the GPE does. Extensive numerical results are presented to confirm the above properties of the new numerical method for rotating BEC in 2D \& 3D.},

The formation of cosmic strings during a symmetry-breaking phase transition shortly after the Big Bang is analogous to vortex creation in liquid helium following a rapid transition into the superfluid state; the underlying physics of this cosmological defect-forming process (known as the Kibble mechanism1) should therefore be accessible to experimental study. Superfluid vortices have been observed in 4He following rapid quenching to the superfluid state2, lending qualitative support to Kibble's contention that topological defects are generated by such phase transitions. Here we quantify this process by using an exothermic neutron-induced nuclear reaction to heat small volumes of super-fluid 3He above the superfluid transition temperature, and then measuring the deficit in energy released as these regions of normal liquid pass back into the superfluid state. By ascribing this deficit to the formation of a tangle of vortices, we are able to infer the resulting vortex density; we find that this agrees very well with the predictions of Zurek's modification3 of the original Kibble mechanism1.},

Quantum gases provide the opportunity to establish a direct link between experiments and generic models that capture the underlying physics. The Dicke model describes a collective matter\textendash light interaction and has been predicted to show an intriguing quantum phase transition. Here we realize the Dicke quantum phase transition in an open system formed by a Bose\textendash Einstein condensate coupled to an optical cavity, and observe the emergence of a self-organized supersolid phase. The phase transition is driven by infinitely long-range interactions between the condensed atoms, induced by two-photon processes involving the cavity mode and a pump field. We show that the phase transition is described by the Dicke Hamiltonian, including counter-rotating coupling terms, and that the supersolid phase is associated with a spontaneously broken spatial symmetry. The boundary of the phase transition is mapped out in quantitative agreement with the Dicke model. Our results should facilitate studies of quantum gases with long-range interactions and provide access to novel quantum phases. The Dicke model describes a collective interaction between matter and light and has been predicted to show an intriguing quantum phase transition. A team from ETH Zurich now reports the realization of the Dicke quantum phase transition in an open system formed by a Bose\textendash Einstein condensate (BEC) coupled to an optical cavity. The predicted phase transition takes place when light falls on the ultracold rubidium atoms that make up the BEC, but surprisingly the atoms are observed to self-organize into a supersolid phase that exhibits characteristics of both superfluids and solids. This work provides a new model for the study of quantum gases and may also offer access to novel quantum phases. A phase transition occurs when a physical system suddenly changes state, for instance when it melts or freezes. The Dicke model describes a collective matter\textendash light interaction and has been predicted to show a quantum phase transition. Here, this quantum phase transition has been realized in an open system formed by a Bose\textendash Einstein condensate coupled to an optical cavity.

The implicitly restarted Arnoldi method for banded matrices with shift-invert is used to solve the linearized spectral stability problem. The rarefaction solitary waves on the upper branch of the Jones-Roberts dispersion curve are shown to be unstable to axisymmetric infinitesimal perturbations, whereas the solitary waves on the lower branch and all two-dimensional solitary waves are linearly stable. The growth rates of the instabilities on the upper branch are so small that an arbitrarily specified initial perturbation of a rarefaction wave at first usually evolves towards the upper branch as it acoustically radiates away its excess energy. This is demonstrated through numerical integrations of the GP equation starting from an initial state consisting of an unstable rarefaction wave and random non-axisymmetric noise. The resulting solution evolves towards, and remains for a significant time in the vicinity of, an unperturbed unstable rarefaction wave. It is shown however that, ultimately (or for an initial state extremely close to the upper branch), the solution evolves onto the lower branch or is completely dissipated as sound. It is shown how density depletions in uniform and trapped condensates can generate rarefaction waves, and a simple method is suggested by which such waves can be created in the laboratory.}

  abstract = {When the insulators lanthanum aluminate and strontium titanate are brought together, the interface between them forms a two-dimensional superconductor. Moreover, magnetic imaging of this interface shows that superconductivity and ferromagnetism coexist in separated nanoscale domains. LaAlO3 and SrTiO3 are insulating, non-magnetic oxides, yet the interface between them exhibits a two-dimensional electron system with high electron mobility1, superconductivity at low temperatures2,3,4,5,6 and electric-field-tuned metal\textendash insulator and superconductor\textendash insulator phase transitions3,6,7,8. Bulk magnetization and magnetoresistance measurements also indicate some form of magnetism depending on preparation conditions5,9,10,11 and a tendency towards nanoscale electronic phase separation10. Here we use local imaging of the magnetization and magnetic susceptibility to directly observe a landscape of ferromagnetism, paramagnetism and superconductivity. We find submicrometre patches of ferromagnetism in a uniform background of paramagnetism, with a non-uniform, weak diamagnetic superconducting susceptibility at low temperature. These results demonstrate the existence of nanoscale phase separation as indicated by theoretical predictions based on nearly degenerate interface sub-bands associated with the Ti orbitals12,13. The magnitude and temperature dependence of the paramagnetic response indicate that the vast majority of the electrons at the interface are localized14, and do not contribute to transport measurements3,6,7. In addition to the implications for magnetism, the existence of a two-dimensional superconductor at an interface with highly broken inversion symmetry and a ferromagnetic landscape in the background indicates the potential for exotic superconducting phenomena.},

Here we develop a mapping of a system of quantum vortices described by the homogeneous 2D Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) to the point-vortex model, enabling Monte Carlo sampling of the vortex microcanonical ensemble. We use this approach to survey the full range of vortex states in a 2D superfluid, from the vortex-dipole gas at positive temperature to negative-temperature states exhibiting both macroscopic vortex clustering and kinetic energy condensation, which we term an Onsager-Kraichnan condensate (OKC). Damped GPE simulations reveal that such OKC states can emerge dynamically, via aggregation of small-scale clusters into giant OKC clusters, as the end states of decaying 2D quantum turbulence in a compressible, finite-temperature superfluid. These statistical equilibrium states should be accessible in atomic Bose-Einstein condensate experiments. \textcopyright{} 2014 American Physical Society.}

We show that a stable coherent interface is established between the two phases, allowing defects of different topology to connect continuously across the boundary. We provide analytic constructions of interface-crossing defect solutions that could be experimentally phase imprinted using existing technology. By numerically minimizing the energy, we calculate the core structures of interface-crossing defect configurations. We demonstrate nontrivial core deformations to considerably more complex structures, such as the formation of an arch-shaped half-quantum line defect, an Alice arch, at the interface, with the topological charge of a point defect, whose emergence may be understood by the "hairy ball" theorem. Another example of an energetically stable object is the connection of a coreless vortex to a pair of half-quantum vortices. We show that rotation leads to spontaneous nucleation of defects in which a coreless vortex continuously transforms to a half-quantum vortex across the interface. \textcopyright{} 2013 American Physical Society.}

Atoms confined to a permanent-magnet trap are laser cooled to 200 {$\mu$}K and are then evaporatively cooled to lower temperatures. Phase-space densities consistent with quantum degeneracy are measured for temperatures in the range of 100 to 400 nK. At these high phase-space densities, diffraction of a probe laser beam is observed. Modeling shows that this diffraction is a sensitive indicator of the presence of a spatially localized condensate. Although measurements of the number of condensate atoms have not been performed, the measured phase-space densities are consistent with a majority of the atoms being in the condensate, for total trap numbers as high as 2\texttimes 105 atoms. For 7Li, the spin-triplet s-wave scattering length is known to be negative, corresponding to an attractive interatomic interaction.

Branes are objects of lower dimensionality embedded in a higher-dimensional matrix. For example, we may live on a three-dimensional brane embedded in a four-dimensional matrix. However, such structures are so far removed from everyday reality that bringing physical insight to bear is difficult. Here we report laboratory experiments where we simulate brane annihilation using the closest brane analogue to which we have access, the coherent phase boundary between the two phases of superfluid 3He. When two branes collide or annihilate, topological defects may be created, whose influence may still be detectable today. By creating a brane\textendash antibrane pair in superfluid 3He and subsequently annihilating it, we can detect that defects are indeed created in the superfluid texture (the superfluid analogue of spacetime), thus confirming that the concept of defect formation after brane annihilation in the early Universe can be reproduced in analogous systems in the\&nbsp;laboratory.},

It uses the asymptotic part of the molecular potential only. The method is applied to recently measured levels at the asymptote (3s+3s) of Na2. We obtain precise values for the two scattering lengths respectively associated to the dissociation limits F1=F2=1,F=2 (55.11.6 a0) and F1=F2=1,F=0 (50.01.6 a0); the first value corresponds to the a1,-1 scattering length usually considered in cold collisions. The extrapolation procedure is also applied to Li2, using existing experimental data.},

We determine where the condensate goes out of equilibrium as it approaches the critical point, and compute the condensate magnetization at the critical point. This is done within a quantum Kibble-Zurek scheme traditionally employed in the context of symmetry-breaking quantum phase transitions. Then we study the influence of the non-equilibrium dynamics near a critical point on the condensate magnetization. In particular, when the quench stops at the critical point, nonlinear oscillations of magnetization occur. They are characterized by a period and an amplitude that are inversely proportional. If we keep driving the condensate far away from the critical point through the unmagnetized 'symmetric' polar phase, the amplitude of magnetization oscillations slowly decreases reaching a nonzero asymptotic value. That process is described by an equation that can be mapped onto the classical mechanical problem of a particle moving under the influence of harmonic and 'anti-friction' forces whose interplay leads to surprisingly simple fixed-amplitude oscillations. We obtain several scaling results relating the condensate magnetization to the quench rate, and verify numerically all analytical predictions. \textcopyright{} IOP Publishing Ltd and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.}

Since electric charges are known to be quantized and no reason for this has yet been proposed apart from the existence of magnetic poles, we have here a reason for taking magnetic poles seriously. The fact that they have not yet been observed may be ascribed to the large value of the quantum of pole. In 1931 I gave a primitive theory which described the motion of a pole in the field of a charged particle whose motion is given, or the motion of a charged particle in the field of a pole whose motion is given. The present paper sets up a general theory of charged particles and poles in interaction through the medium of the electromagnetic field. The idea which makes this generalization possible consists in supposing each pole to be at the end of an observable string, which is the line along which the electromagnetic potentials are singular, and introducing dynamical coordinates and momenta to describe the motion of the strings. The whole theory then comes out by the application of standard methods. There are unsolved difficulties, concerned with the interaction of a point charge or a point pole with the field it produces itself, such as occur in all dynamical theories of fields and particles in interaction. \textcopyright{} 1948 The American Physical Society.}

This inflationary scenario is natural in the brane world picture. In the lowest energy state, a number of branes sit on top of each other (or at an orientifold plane), so the vacuum energy cancels out. In the cosmological setting, some of the branes "start out" relatively displaced in the extra dimensions and the resulting vacuum energy triggers the exponential growth of the 3 non-compact dimensions. The number of e-foldings can be very large due to the very weak brane-brane interaction at large distances. In the effective four-dimensional field theory, the brane motion is described by a slowly rolling scalar field with an extremely flat plateau potential. When branes approach each other to a critical distance, the potential becomes steep and inflation ends rapidly. Then the branes "collide" and oscillate about the equilibrium point, releasing energy mostly into radiation on the branes. In this scenario, it is even possible for the electroweak Higgs field to be the inflaton. \textcopyright{} 1999 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}

  abstract = {Abstract             Dense quantum chromodynamic matter accommodates various kind of topological solitons such as vortices, domain walls, monopoles, kinks, boojums, and so on. In this review, we discuss various properties of topological solitons in dense quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and their phenomenological implications. Particular emphasis is placed on the topological solitons in the color\textendash flavor-locked (CFL) phase, which exhibits both superfluidity and superconductivity. The properties of topological solitons are discussed in terms of effective field theories such as the Ginzburg\textendash Landau theory, the chiral Lagrangian, or the Bogoliubov\textendash de Gennes equation. The most fundamental string-like topological excitations in the CFL phase are non-Abelian vortices, which are 1/3 quantized superfluid vortices and color magnetic flux tubes. These vortices are created at a phase transition by the Kibble\textendash Zurek mechanism or when the CFL phase is realized in compact stars, which rotate rapidly. The interaction between vortices is found to be repulsive and consequently a vortex lattice is formed in rotating CFL matter. Bosonic and fermionic zero-energy modes are trapped in the core of a non-Abelian vortex and propagate along it as gapless excitations. The former consists of translational zero modes (a Kelvin mode) with a quadratic dispersion and \$\{\textbackslash mathbb \{C\}\}P\^2\$ Nambu\textendash Goldstone gapless modes with a linear dispersion, associated with the CFL symmetry spontaneously broken in the core of a vortex, while the latter is Majorana fermion zero modes belonging to the triplet of the symmetry remaining in the core of a vortex. The low-energy effective theory of the bosonic zero modes is constructed as a non-relativistic free complex scalar field and a relativistic \$\{\textbackslash mathbb \{C\}\}P\^2\$ model in 1+1 dimensions. The effects of strange quark mass, electromagnetic interactions, and non-perturbative quantum corrections are taken into account in the \$\{\textbackslash mathbb \{C\}\}P\^2\$ effective theory. Various topological objects associated with non-Abelian vortices are studied; colorful boojums at the CFL interface, the quantum color magnetic monopole confined by vortices, which supports the notion of quark\textendash hadron duality, and Yang\textendash Mills instantons inside a non-Abelian vortex as lumps are discussed. The interactions between a non-Abelian vortex and quasiparticles such as phonons, gluons, mesons, and photons are studied. As a consequence of the interaction with photons, a vortex lattice behaves as a cosmic polarizer. As a remarkable consequence of Majorana fermion zero modes, non-Abelian vortices are shown to behave as a novel kind of non-Abelian anyon. In the order parameters of chiral symmetry breaking, we discuss fractional and integer axial domain walls, Abelian and non-Abelian axial vortices, axial wall\textendash vortex composites, and Skyrmions.},

Four observations are reviewed here: (1) the interplay of different vortex structures at the first-order interface between the two major superfluid 3He phases, 3He-A and 3He-B; (2) the shear flow instability of this phase boundary, which is now known as the superfluid Kelvin-Helmholtz instability; (3) the hydrodynamic transition from turbulent to regular vortex dynamics as a function of increasing dissipation in vortex motion; and (4) the peculiar propagation of vortex lines in a long rotating column which even in the turbulent regime occurs in the form of a helically twisted vortex state behind a well-developed vortex front. The consequences and implications of these observations are discussed, as inferred from measurements, numerical calculations and analytical work. \textcopyright{} 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.}

Condensation is seen in the bimodal momentum distribution and the anisotropic time-of-flight expansion of the condensate. The critical temperature agrees with the theoretical prediction for a uniform Bose gas. The momentum distribution of a noncondensed quantum-degenerate gas is also clearly distinct from the conventional case of a harmonically trapped sample and close to the expected distribution in a uniform system. We confirm the coherence of our condensate in a matter-wave interference experiment. Our experiments open many new possibilities for fundamental studies of many-body physics.},

Tiny inhomogeneities in the mix of particles and radiation produced in the Big Bang grew into the clusters of galaxies that we see today, but how those inhomogeneities arose and grew is still unclear. Cosmologies based on grand unified theories suggest that a symmetry-breaking phase transition occurred via the Higgs mechanism about 10-34 after the Big Bang as the Universe cooled through a critical temperature of 1027 K. It has been proposed by Kibble1 that this transition may have generated defects in the geometry of space-time (such as cosmic strings), which provided the inhomogeneities on which galaxies subsequently condensed. Zurek2\textendash 4 has suggested that it might be possible to model this cosmological phase transition by a laboratory analogue, the superfluid transition of liquid 4He induced by fast adiabatic expansion through the critical density. Here we report the results of such an experiment. We observe copious production of quantized vortices5, the superfluid analogue of cosmic strings. These results support Kibble's contention that such defects were available in the early Universe to seed galaxy formation.},

  abstract = {Quantum vortices in the multi-component Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) are investigated theoretically. It is found that three kinds of the vortex configurations are possible and their physical properties are discussed in details, including the density distribution and the spin texture. By using the Bogoliubov theory extended to the three component BEC, the collective modes for these vortices are evaluated. The local vortex stability for these vortices are examined in light of the existence of the negative eigenvalue, yielding a narrow magnetiza-tion window for the local intrinsic stable region where the multi-components work together to stabilize a vortex in a self-organized way. There have been much attention focused on Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) realized in alkali-metal atom gases. 1-3) In particular, since two experimental groups 4-8) have succeeded in producing quantum vor-tices in a rotating trapped BEC in 87 Rb system, many researchers investigate various aspects of this quantized vortex in the hope to obtain the better understanding of physical nature of superfluidity in this dilute weakly interacting Bose system. Here we have a better controlled mathematical tool, namely, Bogoliubov theory to treat it, compared with superfluid 4 He where no established microscopic theory to treat this strongly interacting Bose condensed system is known. In a series of our papers 9-12) we have been studying the problem of the intrinsic instability of a vortex in BEC. We point out the existence of the negative eigenvalue in the Bogoliubov excitation spectrum, 9) demonstrating that a quantized vortex in BEC confined by a rigid wall is intrinsically unstable and corresponding to the Rokhsar instability 13) due to the spiraling-out of a vortex core in a harmonically trapped BEC. Independently, the existence of the negative value is pointed by Dodd et al. 14) In order to arrest this instability and to stabilize it, we propose several practical devices feasible experimentally, such as sending a laser light at the core center to raise the potential which moves up the whole Bogoliubov spectrum as a result, or raising temperature and increasing the non-condensate fraction relative to the condensation which acts as an extra potential. 11) A similar recovering method is proposed by Doi and Natsume 15) who consider the two component BEC. We also examine the external rotation effect 10) on the vortex stability and determine the several characteristic critical rotation frequencies, 12) including the lowest critical frequency which signals the first entry of a vortex upon increasing the forced rota-* tion. This particular value 12) is by far nearer to the observed stirring frequency in the recent vortex creation experiment by optical spoon 6-8) than that estimated by the conventional Thomas-Fermi approximation. This coincidence further encourages us to perform the present study along this line. So far in all the theories and experiments mentioned above the internal degrees of freedom in an atom is frozen by the external magnetic field serving as a confining potential. By means of optical confinement, all the hy-perfine states with F = 1 in 23 Na are active and three components with m F = 1, 0, -1 are simultaneously Bose-condensed, 16) giving rise to a new state of matter; a BEC characterized by a vectorial order parameter. 17) Ohmi and Machida, 18) and Ho 19) independently introduce the basic Hamiltonian for describing this spinor BEC by extending the Bogoliubov framework and study the fundamental properties of this interesting spinor BEC, pointing out the richness of the topological defect structures such as the l-vector textures, domain wall structure, etc. These are very analogous to the 3 He superfluid A and B phases. 20) Again as the basic interaction in these super-fluid Fermions is strong, we have to resort to the strong coupling theory to describe it. The existing theories for superfluid 3 He is quite phenomenological and difficult to understand microscopically. In contrast, our theory here is quite microscopic and there is no room to introduce phenomenological parameters in it. Guided by this analogy, we are going to study here the vortex structures in more details. Yip 21) gave the first study on a vortex in the spinor BEC, classifying the possible vortex structures as functions of the interaction strength of the spin channel and the magnetization of the system. Unfortunately, some of the vortices introduced by Yip (I and IV phases in ref. 21) are simply not allowed because the fundamental phase requirement is violated for these particular vortices (see eq. (10)). Leonhardt and Volovik 22) propose the half-quantum vortex (Alice 1604},

We dragged a grid barrier through an oblate superfluid Bose-Einstein condensate to generate nonequilibrium distributions of vortices. We observed signatures of an inverse energy cascade driven by the evaporative heating of vortices, leading to steady-state configurations characterized by negative absolute temperatures.

  abstract = {In a two-dimensional (2D) turbulent fluid containing point-like vortices, Lars Onsager predicted that adding energy to the fluid can lead to the formation of persistent clusters of like-signed vortices, i.e., Onsager vortex (OV) clusters. In the evolution of 2D superfluid turbulence in a uniform disk-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), it was discovered that a pair of OV clusters with opposite signs can form without any energy input. This striking spontaneous order was explained as due to a vortex evaporative-heating mechanism, i.e., annihilations of vortex-antivortex pairs which remove the lowest-energy vortices and thereby boost the mean energy per vortex. However, in our search for exotic OV states in a boundaryless 2D spherical BEC, we found that OV clusters never form despite the annihilations of vortex pairs. Our analysis reveals that contrary to the general belief, vortex-pair annihilation emits intense sound waves, which damp the motion of all vortices and hence suppress the formation of OV clusters. We also present unequivocal evidences showing that the true mechanism underlying the observed spontaneous OV state is the escaping of vortices from the BEC boundary. Uncovering this mechanism paves the way for a comprehensive understanding of emergent vortex orders in 2D manifolds of superfluids driven far from equilibrium.}

The characteristic time and length scales of the turbulence generation dynamics are proportional to |q|-1/2 as inherited from the dynamic instability of the initial state. In the evolution of the spin turbulence, spin-wave excitations develop from large to small length scales, suggesting a direct energy cascade, and the spin population for the axial polar domains exhibit a nonexponential decay. The final equilibrated condensate contains HQVs, and the number is found to increase and saturate with increasing |q|.

First, we review the fundamental structure, stability and dynamics of a single vortex state in a slowly rotating two-component condensates. To understand recent experimental results, we use the coupled Gross\textendash Pitaevskii equations and the generalized nonlinear sigma model. An axisymmetric vortex state, which was observed by the JILA group, can be regarded as a topologically trivial skyrmion in the pseudospin representation. The internal, coherent coupling between the two components breaks the axisymmetry of the vortex state, resulting in a stable vortex molecule (a meron pair). We also mention unconventional vortex states and monopole excitations in a spin-1 Bose\textendash Einstein condensate. Next, we discuss a rich variety of vortex states realized in rapidly rotating two-component Bose\textendash Einstein condensates. We introduce a phase diagram with axes of rotation frequency and the intercomponent coupling strength. This phase diagram reveals unconventional vortex states such as a square lattice, a double-core lattice, vortex stripes and vortex sheets, all of which are in an experimentally accessible parameter regime. The coherent coupling leads to an effective attractive interaction between two components, providing not only a promising candidate to tune the intercomponent interaction to study the rich vortex phases but also a new regime to explore vortex states consisting of vortex molecules characterized by anisotropic vorticity. A recent experiment by the JILA group vindicated the formation of a square vortex lattice in this system.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Under the adiabatic limit, we derive the equations of motion for the vortex coordinates, in which the motion is caused by the balance between Magnus force and the intervortex forces. The initial velocity of the vortex motion can be explained quantitatively by this point vortex approximation, but understanding the long-time behavior of the dynamics needs more consideration beyond our model.}

These scattering lengths were extracted previously and found to have overlapping uncertainties for all three cases, thus leaving the nature of the spinor condensates ambiguous.

  abstract = {Topological excitations are usually classified by the nth homotopy group {$\pi$}n. However, for topological excitations that coexist with vortices, there are cases in which an element of {$\pi$}n cannot properly describe the charge of a topological excitation due to the influence of the vortices. This is because an element of {$\pi$}n corresponding to the charge of a topological excitation may change when the topological excitation circumnavigates a vortex. This phenomenon is referred to as the action of {$\pi$}1 on {$\pi$}n. In this paper, we show that topological excitations coexisting with vortices are classified by the Abe homotopy group {$\kappa$}n. The nth Abe homotopy group {$\kappa$}n is defined as a semi-direct product of {$\pi$}1 and {$\pi$}n. In this framework, the action of {$\pi$}1 on {$\pi$}n is understood as originating from noncommutativity between {$\pi$}1 and {$\pi$}n. We show that a physical charge of a topological excitation can be described in terms of the conjugacy class of the Abe homotopy group. Moreover, the Abe homotopy group naturally describes vortex-pair creation and annihilation processes, which also influence topological excitations. We calculate the influence of vortices on topological excitations for the case in which the order parameter manifold is Sn/K, where Sn is an n-dimensional sphere and K is a discrete subgroup of SO(n+1). We show that the influence of vortices on a topological excitation exists only if n is even and K includes a nontrivial element of O(n)/SO(n).},

The vortex-antivortex collisions in the condensate are identified with crescent-shaped, coalesced vortex cores. We observe that the nonexponential decay of the vortex number is quantitatively well described by a rate equation consisting of one-body and two-body decay terms.

In isolated systems, the heat can be defined as an energy increase due to transitions between distinct energy levels. Across a second-order quantum phase transition (QPT), the heat is predicted theoretically to exhibit a power-law scaling, but it is a significant challenge for an experimental observation. In addition, it remains elusive whether a power-law scaling of heat can exist for a first-order QPT. Here we experimentally observe a power-law scaling of heat in a spinor condensate when a system is linearly driven from a polar phase to an antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase across a first-order QPT. We experimentally evaluate the heat generated during two non-equilibrium processes by probing the atom number on a hyperfine energy level. The experimentally measured scaling exponents agree well with our numerical simulation results. Our work therefore opens a new avenue to experimentally and theoretically exploring the properties of heat in non-equilibrium dynamics.},

The velocity of any member of the family is shown, both numerically and analytically, to be aE/ap, the derivative being taken along the family. At great distances, the disturbance in the condensate is pseudo-dipolar (dipolar in a stretched coordinate system); the strength of the pseudo-dipole moment is obtained numerically. Analogous calculations are presented for the corresponding two-dimensional problem. Again, a continuous sequence of solitary waves is obtained, but the momentum per unit length p and energy per unit length E have no minima. For small forward velocities, the wave consists of two widely separated parallel, oppositely directed line vortices. As the forward velocity increases the wave loses its vorticity and becomes a rarefaction pulse of ever increasing spatial extent but ever decreasing amplitude.

Constructing spinor wave functions for vortex states that continuously connect ferromagnetic and polar phases, we systematically derive analytic models for nonrotating cores of different singular vortices and for composite defect states with distinct small- and large-distance topology. We explain how the conservation law provides a stabilizing mechanism when the coreless vortex imprinted on the condensate relaxes in the polar regime of interatomic interactions. The resulting structure forms a composite defect: The inner ferromagnetic coreless vortex deforms toward an outer singly quantized polar vortex. We also numerically show how other even more complex hierarchies of vortex-core topologies may be stabilized. Moreover, we analyze the structure of the coreless vortex also in a ferromagnetic condensate and show how reducing magnetization leads to a displacement of the vortex from the trap center and eventually to the deformation and splitting of its core where a singular vortex becomes a lower-energy state. For the case of singular vortices, we find that the stability and the core structure are notably less influenced by the conservation of magnetization.}

  abstract = {Antiferromagnetic condensates are generally believed not to display modulational instability and subsequent spin-domain formation. Here we demonstrate that in the presence of a homogeneous magnetic field antiferromagnetic spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates can undergo spatial modulational instability followed by the subsequent generation of spin domains. Employing numerical simulations for realistic conditions, we show how this effect can be observed in sodium condensates confined in an optical trap. Finally, we link this instability and spin-domain formation with stationary modes of the condensate. \textcopyright{} 2008 The American Physical Society.}

We exploit both types of system criticality as a resource in the precise estimation of the control parameter value. We quantify the achievable precision by the quantum Fisher information. We demonstrate supersensitivity and show that the precision scales with the number of atoms up to N4 around criticality. In addition, we study the precision based on the error-propagation formula, which provides a simple-to-measure signal whose scaling coincides with the quantum Fisher information. Finally, we take into account the effect of nonzero temperature and show that sub-shot-noise sensitivity in the estimation of the control parameter is achievable in the low-temperature limit.}

Specifically, we leverage fixed-point and numerical continuation techniques in three spatial dimensions to identify solution families of monopole and Alice rings as the chemical potential (number of atoms) and trapping strengths are varied within intervals of realizable experimental parameters. We are able to follow the monopole from the linear limit of small atom number all the way to the Thomas-Fermi regime of large atom number. Additionally, and importantly, our studies reveal the existence of two Alice ring solution branches, corresponding to, relatively, smaller and larger ring radii, that bifurcate from each other in a saddle-center bifurcation as the chemical potential is varied. We find that the monopole solution is always dynamically unstable in the regimes considered. In contrast, we find that the larger Alice ring is indeed stable close to the bifurcation point until it destabilizes from an oscillatory instability bubble for a larger value of the chemical potential. We also report on the possibility of dramatically reducing, yet not completely eliminating, the instability rates for the smaller Alice ring by varying the trapping strengths. The dynamical evolution of the different unstable waveforms is also probed via direct numerical simulations.}

Universal power-law distributions, previously found within a nonperturbative quantum-field theoretical approach and recently shown to be related to vortical dynamics and superfluid turbulence, are studied in detail. The results imply an interpretation of the scaling behavior in terms of independent vortex excitations of the superfluid and show that the statistics of topological excitations can be described in the framework of wave turbulence. The particular scaling exponents observed in the single-particle momentum distributions are found to be consistent with irreversibility as well as conservation laws obeyed by the wave interactions. Moreover, long-wavelength acoustic excitations of the vortex-bearing condensate, driven by vortex annihilations, are found to follow a nonthermal power law. Considering vortex correlations in a statistical model, the long-time departure from the nonthermal fixed point is related to vortex-antivortex pairing. The studied nonthermal fixed points are accessible in cold-gas experiments. The results shed light on fundamental aspects of superfluid turbulence and have strong potential implications for related phenomena, for example, in early universe inflation or quark-gluon plasma dynamics. \textcopyright{} 2012 American Physical Society.}

As the condensate undergoes a change between magnetic phases, the isolated monopole gradually evolves into a spin configuration hosting a Dirac monopole in its synthetic magnetic field. We characterize in detail the Dirac monopole by measuring the particle densities of the spin states projected along different quantization axes. Importantly, we observe the spontaneous emergence of nodal lines in the condensate density that accompany the Dirac monopole. We also demonstrate that the monopole decay accelerates in weaker magnetic field gradients.},

Three-dimensional topological objects of localised particle-like nature attract broad interest across discipline boundaries from elementary particle physics and cosmology to condensed matter physics. Here we propose how simple structured light beams can be transformed into optical excitations of atoms with considerably more complex topologies representing three-dimensional particle-like Skyrmions. This construction can also be described in terms of linked Hopf maps, analogous to knotted solitons of the Skyrme-Faddeev model. We identify the transverse polarisation density current as the effective magnetic gauge potential for the Chern-Simons helicity term. While we prepare simpler two-dimensional baby-Skyrmions and singular defects using the traditional Stokes vectors on the Poincar\'e sphere for light, particle-like topologies can only be achieved in the full optical hypersphere description that no longer discards the variation of the total electromagnetic phase of vibration.},

  abstract = {Predicting the dynamics of quantum systems far from equilibrium represents one of the most challenging problems in theoretical many-body physics1,2. While the evolution of a many-body system is in general intractable in all its details, relevant observables can become insensitive to microscopic system parameters and initial conditions. This is the basis of the phenomenon of universality. Far from equilibrium, universality is identified through the scaling of the spatio-temporal evolution of the system, captured by universal exponents and functions. Theoretically, this has been studied in examples as different as the reheating process in inflationary Universe cosmology3,4, the dynamics of nuclear collision experiments described by quantum chromodynamics5,6, and the post-quench dynamics in dilute quantum gases in non-relativistic quantum field theory7\textendash 11. However, an experimental demonstration of such scaling evolution in space and time in a quantum many-body system has been lacking. Here we observe the emergence of universal dynamics by evaluating spatially resolved spin correlations in a quasi-one-dimensional spinor Bose\textendash Einstein condensate12\textendash 16. For long evolution times we extract the scaling properties from the spatial correlations of the spin excitations. From this we find the dynamics to be governed by an emergent conserved quantity\&nbsp;and the transport of spin excitations towards low momentum scales. Our results establish an important class of non-stationary systems whose dynamics is encoded in time-independent scaling exponents and functions, signalling the existence of non-thermal fixed points10,17,18. We confirm that the non-thermal scaling phenomenon involves no fine-tuning\&nbsp;of parameters, by preparing different initial conditions and observing the same scaling behaviour. Our analogue quantum simulation approach provides the basis with which to reveal the underlying mechanisms and characteristics of non-thermal universality classes. One may use this universality to learn, from experiments with ultracold gases, about fundamental aspects of dynamics studied in cosmology and quantum chromodynamics. The emergence of universal dynamics far from equilibrium is observed by evaluating spatially resolved spin correlations in a quasi-one-dimensional spinor Bose\textendash Einstein condensate.},

However, for first-order quantum phase transitions, the Kibble-Zurek mechanism is usually not applicable. Here, we experimentally demonstrate and theoretically analyze a power-law scaling in the dynamics of a spin-1 condensate across a first-order quantum phase transition when a system is slowly driven from a polar phase to an antiferromagnetic phase. We show that this power-law scaling can be described by a generalized Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Furthermore, by experimentally measuring the spin population, we show the power-law scaling of the temporal onset of spin excitations with respect to the quench rate, which agrees well with our numerical simulation results. Our results open the door for further exploring the generalized Kibble-Zurek mechanism to understand the dynamics across first-order quantum phase transitions.},

The forcing injects large amounts of vortex energy into the system at the scale of a few healing lengths. A regime of forcing and damping is identified where vortex energy is efficiently transported to large length scales via an inverse energy cascade associated with the growth of clusters of same-circulation vortices, a Kolmogorov scaling law in the kinetic energy spectrum over a substantial inertial range, and spectral condensation of kinetic energy at the scale of the system size.

By developing a rigorous link between the velocity probability distribution and the quantum kinetic energy spectrum over wave number k, we show that the coherent vortex structures are associated with a k3 power law in the infrared region of the spectrum, and a well-defined spectral peak that is a physical manifestation of the largest structures.

We propose a scheme to generate controllable, repeatable, deterministic collisional events in pairs of quantum vortices. We demonstrate two mass-driven fundamental processes: (i) the annihilation of two counter-rotating vortices and (ii) the merging of two co-rotating vortices, thus pointing out new mechanisms supporting incompressible-to-compressible kinetic energy conversion, as well as doubly-quantized vortices stabilization in flat superfluids.}

The theory describing this cosmological phase transition is formally analogous to that describing the transition to the superfluid state in liquid 3He, so that in principle the process of cosmological defect formation can be modelled in the laboratory. Here we report the results of an experiment in which the 'primordial fireball' is mimicked using a neutron-induced nuclear reaction (n + 3He \textrightarrow{} p + 3He + 0.76 MeV) to heat small regions of superfluid 3He above the superfluid transition temperature. These bubbles of normal liquid cool extremely rapidly, and we find that their transition back to the superfluid state is accompanied by the formation of a random network of vortices (the superfluid analogue of cosmic strings). We monitor the evolution of this defect state by rotating the superfluid sample, allowing vortices to escape from the network and thus be probed individually. Our results provide clear confirmation of the idea that topological defects form at a rapid second-order phase transition, and give quantitative support to the Kibble\textendash Zurek mechanism5,6 of cosmological defect formation.},

The flow persists without decay for up to 10 s, limited only by experimental factors such as drift and trap lifetime. The quantized rotation was initiated by transferring one unit of the orbital angular momentum from Laguerre-Gaussian photons to each atom. Stable flow was only possible when the trap was multiply connected, and was observed with a Bose-Einstein condensate fraction as small as 20\%. We also created flow with two units of angular momentum and observed its splitting into two singly charged vortices when the trap geometry was changed from multiply to simply connected.},

The formation of ferromagnetic domains and domain walls is observed, and spin vortices (containing non-zero spin current but no net mass current) detected in situ. A central goal in condensed matter and modern atomic physics is the exploration of quantum phases of matter\textemdash in particular, how the universal characteristics of zero-temperature quantum phase transitions differ from those established for thermal phase transitions at non-zero temperature. Compared to conventional condensed matter systems, atomic gases provide a unique opportunity to explore quantum dynamics far from equilibrium. For example, gaseous spinor Bose\textendash Einstein condensates1,2,3 (whose atoms have non-zero internal angular momentum) are quantum fluids that simultaneously realize superfluidity and magnetism, both of which are associated with symmetry breaking. Here we explore spontaneous symmetry breaking in 87Rb spinor condensates, rapidly quenched across a quantum phase transition to a ferromagnetic state. We observe the formation of spin textures, ferromagnetic domains and domain walls, and demonstrate phase-sensitive in situ detection of spin vortices. The latter are topological defects resulting from the symmetry breaking, containing non-zero spin current but no net mass current4.},

We employ weak turbulence theory to provide a complete thermodynamic description of the classical condensation process. We show that the temperature and the condensate mass fractions are fully determined by the total number of particles in each component and the initial total energy. Moreover, we find that, at higher energies, condensation can occur in only one component. We derive an analytic result for the variation of the critical energy where this transition occurs.

We show that the subsystem of vortex gas excitations results in the spontaneous emergence of a coherent superfluid flow with a nonzero coarse-grained vorticity field. The stream function of this emergent quasiclassical 2D flow is governed by a Poisson-Boltzmann equation. This equation reveals that maximum entropy states of a neutral vortex gas that describe the spectral condensation of energy can be classified into types of flow depending on whether or not the flow spontaneously acquires angular momentum. Numerical simulations of a neutral point vortex model and a Bose gas governed by the 2D Gross-Pitaevskii equation in a square reveal that a large-scale monopole flow field with net angular momentum emerges that is consistent with predictions of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation. The results allow us to characterize the spectral energy condensate in a 2D quantum fluid that bears striking similarity to similar flows observed in experiments of 2D classical turbulence. By deforming the square into a rectangular region, the resulting maximum entropy state switches to a dipolar flow field with zero net angular momentum.}

The dynamics of HQV pair formation is characterized by measuring the temporal evolutions of the pair separation distance and the core magnetization, which reveals the short-range nature of the repulsive interactions between the HQVs.

An interesting question is whether this phenomenon can occur in a superfluid, which is inviscid and irrotational by nature. Atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) of highly oblate geometry provide an experimental venue for studying 2D superfluid turbulence, but their full investigation has been hindered due to a lack of the circulation sign information of individual quantum vortices in a turbulent sample. Here, we demonstrate a vortex sign detection method by using Bragg scattering, and we investigate decaying turbulence in a highly oblate BEC at low temperatures, with our lowest being \textasciitilde 0.5T c , where T c is the superfluid critical temperature. We observe that weak spatial pairing between vortices and antivortices develops in the turbulent BEC, which corresponds to the vortex-dipole gas regime predicted for high dissipation.

We demonstrate that this occurs due to a novel physical mechanism - the evaporative heating of the vortices - that results in a negative-temperature phase transition in the vortex degrees of freedom.

These transitions are particularly interesting for, in contrast to their classical finite-temperature counterparts, their dynamic and static critical behaviors are intimately intertwined. Considerable insight is gained by considering the path-integral description of the quantum statistical mechanics of such systems, which takes the form of the classical statistical mechanics of a system in which time appears as an extra dimension. In particular, this allows the deduction of scaling forms for the finite-temperature behavior, which turns out to be described by the theory of finite-size scaling. It also leads naturally to the notion of a temperature-dependent dephasing length that governs the crossover between quantum and classical fluctuations. Using these ideas, a scaling analysis of experiments on Josephson-junction arrays and quantum-Hall-effect systems is presented.},

Densities of up to 3 \texttimes{} 1015cm-3 of Bose condensed atoms were obtained, allowing for a measurement of the three-body loss rate constant for sodium condensates as K3 = 1.1(3) \texttimes{} 10-30cm6s-1. At lower densities, the observed 1/e lifetime was longer than 10 s. Simultaneous confinement of Bose-Einstein condensates in several hyperfine states was demonstrated. \textcopyright{} 1998 The American Physical Society.}

  abstract = {Spinor Bose gases form a family of quantum fluids manifesting both magnetic order and superfluidity. This article reviews experimental and theoretical progress in understanding the static and dynamic properties of these fluids. The connection between system properties and the rotational symmetry properties of the atomic states and their interactions are investigated. Following a review of the experimental techniques used for characterizing spinor gases, their mean-field and many-body ground states, both in isolation and under the application of symmetry-breaking external fields, are discussed. These states serve as the starting point for understanding low-energy dynamics, spin textures, and topological defects, effects of magnetic-dipole interactions, and various nonequilibrium collective spin-mixing phenomena. The paper aims to form connections and establish coherence among the vast range of works on spinor Bose gases, so as to point to open questions and future research opportunities. \textcopyright{} 2013 American Physical Society.}

In the presence of surface-induced disorder the correlation lengths, parallel and perpendicular to the surface, diverge at the bulk transition point. In this way the surface induces an anisotropic power-law singular behavior for some bulk quantities. For example, in a finite system of transverse linear size L, the response functions diverge as L(d-1)z+1, where d is the dimension of the system and z is the anisotropy exponent. We present a general scaling picture for this anisotropic discontinuity fixed point. Our phenomenological results are confronted with analytical and numerical calculations on the two-dimensional q-state Potts model in the large-q limit. The scaling results are demonstrated to apply also for the same model with a layered, Fibonacci-type modulation of the couplings for which the anisotropy exponent is a continuous function of the strength of the quasiperiodic perturbation.},

By utilising the pseudo-vorticity field of the associated complex scalar order parameter of the superfluid, we are able to track the topological defects of the superfluid and reconstruct the vortex lines which correspond to zeros of the field. Throughout, we assume our field is periodic to allow us to make extensive use of the Fourier representation of the field and its derivatives in order to retain spectral accuracy. We present several case studies to test the precision of the method which include the evaluation of the curvature and torsion of a torus vortex knot, and the measurement of the Kelvin wave spectrum of a vortex line and a vortex ring. The method we present makes no a priori assumptions on the geometry of the vortices and is therefore applicable to a wide range of systems such as a superfluid in a turbulent state that is characterised by many vortex rings coexisting with sound waves. This allows us to track the positions of the vortex filaments in a dense turbulent vortex tangle and extract statistical information about the distribution of the size of the vortex rings and the inter-vortex separations. In principle, the method can be extended to track similar topological defects arising in other physical systems.},

Power-law distributions of simulated glitch sizes are obtained, in accord with astronomical observations, with exponents ranging from -0.55 to -1.26. Examples of large-scale simulations, containing {$\sim$}200 vortices, reveal that these statistics persist in the many-vortex limit. Waiting-time distributions are also constructed. These and other statistics support the hypothesis that catastrophic unpinning mediated by collective vortex motion produces glitches; indeed, such collective events are seen in time-lapse movies of superfluid density. Three principal trends are observed. (1) The glitch rate scales proportional to the electromagnetic spin-down torque. (2) A strong positive correlation is found between the strength of vortex pinning and mean glitch size. (3) The spin-down dynamics depend less on the pinning site abundance once the latter exceeds one site per vortex, suggesting that unpinned vortices travel a distance comparable to the intervortex spacing before repinning.},

  abstract = {Phase transitions are ubiquitous in nature, and can be arranged into universality classes such that systems having unrelated microscopic physics show identical scaling behaviour near the critical point. One prominent universal element of many continuous phase transitions is the spontaneous formation of topological defects during a quench through the critical point. The microscopic dynamics of defect formation in such transitions are generally difficult to investigate, particularly for superfluids. However, Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) offer unique experimental and theoretical opportunities for probing these details. Here we present an experimental and theoretical study of the BEC phase transition of a trapped atomic gas, in which we observe and statistically characterize the spontaneous formation of vortices during condensation. Using microscopic theories that incorporate atomic interactions and quantum and thermal fluctuations of a finite-temperature Bose gas, we simulate condensation and observe vortex formation in close quantitative agreement with our experimental results. Our studies provide further understanding of the development of coherence in superfluids, and may allow for direct investigation of universal phase transition dynamics. \textcopyright 2008 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

  abstract = {Persistent topological defects and textures are particularly dramatic consequences of superfluidity. Among the most fascinating examples are the singular vortices arising from the rotational symmetry group SO(3), with surprising topological properties illustrated by Dirac's famous belt trick. Despite considerable interest, controlled preparation and detailed study of vortex lines with complex internal structure in fully three-dimensional spinor systems remains an outstanding experimental challenge. Here, we propose and implement a reproducible and controllable method for creating and detecting a singular SO(3) line vortex from the decay of a non-singular spin texture in a ferromagnetic spin-1 Bose\textendash Einstein condensate. Our experiment explicitly demonstrates the SO(3) character and the unique spinor properties of the defect. Although the vortex is singular, its core fills with atoms in the topologically distinct polar magnetic phase. The resulting stable, coherent topological interface has analogues in systems ranging from condensed matter to cosmology and string theory. Topological defects and textures are universal phenomena across physics. The authors demonstrate that an initial non-singular spinor texture can be controllably transformed into a pair of singular vortices with cores filled by atoms that continuously connect distinct magnetic phases of matter.},

  abstract = {We examine the dynamics of a quasi-two-dimensional spin-1 condensate in which the quadratic Zeeman energy q is suddenly quenched to a value where the system has a ferromagnetic ground state. There are two distinct types of ferromagnetic phases, i.e., a range of q values where the magnetization prefers to be in the direction of the external field (easy axis) and a range of q values where it prefers to be transverse to the field (easy plane). We study the quench dynamics for a variety of q values and show that there is a single dynamic critical exponent to characterize the scale-invariant domain growth for each ferromagnetic phase. For both quenches we give simple analytic models that capture the essential scale-invariant dynamics and correctly predict the exponents. Because the order parameter for each phase is different, the natures of the domains and the relevant topological defects in each type of coarsening are also different. To explore these differences we characterize the fractal dimension of the domain walls and the relationship of polar-core spin vortices to the domains in the easy-plane phase. Finally, we consider how the energy liberated from the quench thermalizes in the easy-axis quench. We show that local equilibrium is established in the spin waves on moderate time scales, but continues to evolve as the domains anneal.}

For a purely transversely magnetized system, the Turner point-vortex model predicts that PCVs behave like massive charged particles interacting via a two-dimensional Coulomb potential. We test the accuracy of the Turner model for two oppositely charged PCVs, via comparisons with numerical simulations. While the bare Turner model shows discrepancies with our numerical results, we find that a simple rescaling of the PCV mass gives much better agreement. This can be explained via a phenomenological damping arising from coupling to modes extrinsic to the point-vortex phase space. We also identify the excitations produced following PCV annihilation, which help elucidate recent phase ordering results. We extend the Turner model to cases where the system is magnetized both transversally and axially, identifying a crossover to scalar vortex dynamics for increasing external Zeeman field.}

A process of phase-imprinting a nonsingular vortex, its decay into a pair of singular spinor vortices, and a rapid exchange of magnetic phases creates a pair of three-dimensional, singular singly-quantized vortex lines with core regions that are filled with atoms in the ferromagnetic phase. Atomic interactions guide the subsequent vortex dynamics, leading to core structures that suggest the decay of the singly-quantized vortices into half-quantum vortices. Superfluid vortices are important in many diverse systems, including spinor Bose-Einstein condensates. Here, the experimental and theoretical analysis of the creation and time evolution of vortices in the polar phase of a spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate is presented, showing the evolution of single-quantum vortices towards half-quantum ones.},

When crossing the critical point, the fluctuation of momentum distribution leads to delayed bifurcation structures. Simultaneously, the domain information emerges in momentum space. Moreover, the universal scalings of spatiotemporal dynamics are extracted from the fluctuations and domains, which manifests homogeneous and inhomogeneous Kibble-Zurek power laws at different timescales.

Here we show direct experimental evidence of spin-nematic ordering in a spin 1 Bose-Einstein condensate of sodium atoms with antiferromagnetic interactions. In a mean field description this order is enforced by locking the relative phase between spin components. We reveal this mechanism by studying the spin noise after a spin rotation, which is shown to contain information hidden when looking only at averages.
