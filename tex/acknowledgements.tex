I would like to thank the many people who helped make my PhD an enjoyable
and unforgettable experience.
Firstly, my heartfelt thanks go out to my supervisors Magnus Borgh and Hayder
Salman for their invaluable support, wisdom, and enthusiasm as I traversed my
PhD.
Whether it was a simple chat over coffee or a multi-hour session at the
blackboard, I walk away from the experience a better person and physicist.
Thanks again to Hayder who hosted me at Cambridge and showed me a spectacular
research environment outside the concrete of UEA\@.

Thanks to Giuseppe and Dan who made the office an enjoyable place to be, in
addition to making our small but brilliant physics team what it was.
To Sophie and Luke, for keeping me sane throughout my years at UEA, hosting
great dinner parties, and painful but always enjoyable runs.
To Danny, Isaac, and Palmer for making my undergraduate experience what it was,
there would be no PhD without your companionship.
Thanks to my parents, whose unrelenting love and support which made me who I am
and allowed me to pursue physics.
Lastly, to Pete, for your love, patience, and understanding as I have traversed
this challenging and rewarding PhD journey.
