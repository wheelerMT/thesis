\chapter{\label{chap: spin-1}Generalised Kibble-Zurek scaling in a spin-1
Bose-Einstein condensate}

Nonequilibrium phase transitions are ubiquitous, arising in many areas of
physics, including cosmology~\cite{Kibble1980,Mazumdar2019}, condensed
matter~\cite{Chuang1991,Hendry1994,Bauerle1996,Ruutu1996,Sondhi1997,
Polkovnikov2011}, and ultracold atomic gases~\cite{Hadzibabic2006,Langen2015,
Fletcher2015,Liu2018}.
A quantum phase transition (QPT), in contrast to its classical counterpart, is a
zero-temperature transition driven by quantum fluctuations~\cite{Sachdev2011}.
In such a transition, a fundamental change of ground state occurs as an external
parameter is varied across the quantum critical point.
For a continuous phase transition, as this critical point is passed, the
timescale governing the dynamics diverges, resulting in the system no longer
adiabatically following the ground state.
This non-adiabatic evolution implies that the symmetry of the system is broken
independently in causally disconnected regions, which typically results in the
formation of topological defects.
The Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) is a theory that describes the resulting
dynamics and predicts the scaling properties of the excitations from the details
of the universality class of the transition.
It was first introduced by Kibble in the context of cosmological phase
transitions in the early universe~\cite{Kibble1976, Kibble1980}, before being
extended by Zurek to condensed matter systems~\cite{Zurek1985, Zurek1993,
    Zurek1996}.

Any continuous phase transition can be modelled using the KZ theory, and due to
this robustness, it has been successfully applied to both
classical~\cite{Donadello2016,Beugnon2017} and
quantum~\cite{Dziarmaga2005, Damski2005, Lamacraft2007} phase transitions.
Whilst the theory has had great success in applications to continuous,
second-order transitions, direct application to discontinuous phase transitions
does not typically give an accurate description of observed scaling laws.
This is due to the fact that at the critical point of a continuous phase
transition the energy spectrum is gapped, in which well-defined correlation
lengths and time scales can be derived.
In a first-order, discontinuous phase transition, the energy spectrum at the
critical point is gapless, and hence the traditional KZ theory breaks down.
Recently, there has been the first experimental evidence of the existence of
scaling laws for a first-order QPT~\cite{Qiu2020}, where standard KZ theory
failed to predict the observed scaling.
However, the KZM was generalised by considering the energy gap between the
metastable state and its first corresponding excited state, which then gave an
accurate prediction of the observed scaling laws.
There is current interest in trying to generalise the KZM and applying it to
discontinuous transitions and deriving appropriate scaling
laws~\cite{Divakaran2008, Suzuki2015}.

The seminal work of Fisher and Berker~\cite{Fisher1982}, in the classical case,
first discussed a particular type of discontinuous, first-order transition and
introduced the notion of a discontinuous critical point (DCP).
Such a DCP separates two distinct phases, characterized by a discontinuous jump
in the order parameter.
Despite the discontinuity, the transition can still be characterized by a
diverging length scale and hence critical exponents can be derived.
This framework was then extended to the quantum case, specifying the conditions
for a discontinuous quantum critical point (DQCP)~\cite{Suzuki2015}.
The DQCP leads to a prediction of the scaling of the defect density that is
modified from the typical KZ scenario.

Spinor BECs offer a highly controllable platform for studying non-equilibrium
physics, ranging from topological defects~\cite{Lovegrove2014, Borgh2016} to
quantum quenches~\cite{Symes2017, Prufer2018, Schmied2019}.
In addition, their rich phase diagram has seen the KZM applied both numerically
and experimentally in various continuous phase transitions~\cite{Damski2007,
    Saito2007, Saito2007a, Swislocki2013, Witkowska2013, Anquez2016}.
For a ferromagnetic spin-1 BEC, there exists a first-order QPT between a
three-component broken-axisymmetry (BA) phase and a ferromagnetic (FM) phase,
making this system an ideal platform for investigating the KZM across
discontinuous transitions.

In this Chapter we analytically and numerically investigate the KZM in a 1D FM
spin-1 BEC\@.
By quenching the quadratic Zeeman shift, we are able to quench the system
through both continuous and discontinuous phase transitions.
In particular, we first examine the resulting scaling laws associated with
quenching through the continuous phase transition from the polar phase to the
BA phase, and confirm that these are in excellent agreement with the KZ theory.
Then, we extend the KZM to predict the scaling laws of the discontinuous,
first-order phase transition between the BA and FM phases.
Quenching the quadratic Zeeman shift allows the system to change from the
BA phase into a phase-separated FM phase, where domains with opposing
condensate-spin projection develop~\cite{Kawaguchi2012}.
We show that, despite this particular transition having a gapless spectrum, the
standard KZ theory can be generalised and extended to cover discontinuous,
first-order transitions.
In addition, scaling behaviour near the critical point is derived by means of
linearising the mean-field equations for the spin-1
condensate~\cite{Damski2007, Uchino2010}.
Predicted scaling laws are then confirmed by direct numerical simulations.

\section{The Kibble-Zurek mechanism}\label{sec: the-KZM}
Consider a system that undergoes a spontaneous breaking of symmetry when a
control parameter, \( \lambda \), is ramped across a phase transition that
occurs at the critical point, \( \lambda_c \).
A continuous, second-order phase transition can be characterized by a divergence
of the equilibrium correlation length~\cite{DelCampo2014}
\begin{equation}
    \xi(\epsilon) \sim |\epsilon|^{-\nu},
\end{equation}
and an equilibrium relaxation time
\begin{equation}
    \tau(\epsilon) \sim \xi^z \sim |\epsilon|^{-\nu z},
    \label{eq: equil-relax-time}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
    \epsilon = \frac{\lambda - \lambda_c}{\lambda_c}
\end{equation}
is the dimensionless distance from the critical point.
The equilibrium relaxation time \( \tau \) describes the time it takes for the
system to react to an external change of a parameter.
In a quantum phase transition, the relaxation time is set by the inverse of an
energy gap \( \Delta \) between the ground state and the first excited
state~\cite{Zurek2005, Damski2006}
\begin{equation}
    \tau \simeq \Delta^{-1}.
\end{equation}
As we approach the critical point, the energy gap vanishes as
\begin{equation}\label{eq: delta-epsilon-relation}
    \Delta \sim |\epsilon|^{\nu z}.
\end{equation}
The system is initially prepared in a high-symmetry phase (\(  \epsilon > 0 \)),
but breaks that symmetry as the critical point is crossed (\(  \epsilon < 0 \)).
In the above equations, the exponents \(  z \) and \( \nu \) are the dynamical
and correlation length critical exponents, respectively.
Different systems which have the same critical exponents are said to belong
to the same universality class~\cite{Sachdev2011,DelCampo2014}.

The KZM describes the dynamics of crossing the critical point when \( \lambda \)
is continually varied.
We assume the form of a linear quench (cases concerning non-linear quenches are
discussed in Refs.~\cite{Barankov2008,Mondal2009}), such that the control
parameter can be written as
\begin{equation}
    \lambda(t) = \lambda_c\left[1 - \epsilon(t)\right],
\end{equation}
where the distance to the critical point is
\begin{equation}
    \epsilon(t) = \frac{t}{\tau_Q},
    \label{eq: time-dependent-epsilon}
\end{equation}
for a quench time \( \tau_Q \).
This form gives a transition rate \( |\dot{\epsilon}/{\epsilon}|=t^{-1} \) which
diverges as we approach the critical point.
Here, \( t \in [-\tau_Q, \tau_Q] \), where the critical point is reached at
\( t=0 \).
The dynamics of the system can be broken into three stages as \( \epsilon \) is
ramped from \( \epsilon > 0 \) to \( \epsilon < 0 \): adiabatic, frozen, and
adiabatic again (see Fig.~\ref{fig: adiabatic-impulse} for a schematic
representation).

        linear quench]
    {A schematic representation of the dynamics of a system during a
    linear quench. The system starts in a high-symmetry phase (\( t > 0 \)) and
    is quenched across a critical point to a low symmetry phase (\( t < 0 \)) by
    the reduced control parameter (red dashed line) \( \epsilon(t) = t/\tau_Q\).
    As the critical point is approached, the equilibrium relaxation time
    (blue line) diverges, and the order parameter can no longer follow the
    ground state, leading to frozen dynamics in the interval
    \( t \in [-\tilde{t}, \tilde{t}] \)}.\label{fig: adiabatic-impulse}
\end{figure}

Far from the critical point, the equilibrium relaxation time is small compared
to the inverse transition rate \( |\epsilon/\dot{\epsilon}| \), meaning the
system adiabatically follows the instantaneous ground state for \(\epsilon(t)\).
This stage of adiabaticity lasts until the relaxation time becomes comparable
to \(|\epsilon / \dot{\epsilon}|\):
\begin{equation}
    \tau \approx |\epsilon/\dot{\epsilon}|=\tilde{t}.
    \label{eq: freeze-out-equal}
\end{equation}
Using Eqs.~\eqref{eq: delta-epsilon-relation}
and~\eqref{eq: time-dependent-epsilon}, the above equation can be solved to
yield the freeze-out time, \( \tilde{t} \):
\begin{equation}
    \tilde{t} \sim \tau_Q^\frac{z\nu}{1 + z\nu}.
    \label{eq: freeze-out-scaling}
\end{equation}
After the freeze-out time is passed, however, the relaxation time diverges and
the system can no longer keep up with the externally imposed changes.
The system then enters the so-called impulse regime, where the dynamics are
frozen and remains in this regime until \( -\tilde{t} \), when the relaxation
time becomes faster than the transition rate once again.
The consequence of the impulse region, however, is that the system arrives at
\( -\tilde{t} \), in which the true ground state is in a broken-symmetry phase,
whilst remaining in the state set at \( \tilde{t} \), which corresponds to a
symmetric phase.
This state at \( \tilde{t} \) then becomes the initial state for the last
adiabatic stage of evolution beginning at \( -\tilde{t} \).
At this point, the system is no longer in its current ground state and rectifies
this by breaking the symmetry of the initial state.
This results in the formation of distinct domains in the system whose size is
set by the value of the equilibrium correlation length at the freeze-out time
\begin{equation}
    \hat{\xi}=\xi(\tilde{t}) \sim \tau_Q^{\frac{\nu}{1 + z\nu}}.
    \label{eq: KZM-domain-size}
\end{equation}
If the system supports topological defects such as vortices, then the defect
density is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq: KZM-defects-scaling}
    N_d \simeq \hat{\xi}^{-d} \sim \tau_Q^{\frac{-d\nu}{1+z\nu}},
\end{equation}
where \( d \) is the number of spatial dimensions.
This key provides a foundation in testing the KZM in subsequent sections, and
has already been successfully applied to numerous spinor BEC
systems~\cite{Damski2007, Swislocki2013, Anquez2016, Saito2007, Saito2007a} to
determine the validity of the KZM\@.

\section{Numerical studies of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism across a second-order
quantum phase transition}
To verify the key results of the KZ theory presented in the previous section,
we perform numerical simulations using a spin-1 BEC\@.
As shown in Sec.~\ref{sec: ground-states-spin-1}, there are four ground state
phases of spin-1 BECs; namely, the ferromagnetic, partially-magnetised polar,
polar, and broken-axisymmetry phases, where each ground state phase has an
associated symmetry.
The Kibble-Zurek mechanism can be studied in spin-1 BECs by considering how
the change of a control parameter causes the order parameter to change from
one ground state to another.
As it does this, the symmetry of the system is spontaneously broken, and hence
the Kibble-Zurek theory can be applied.

Spin-1 BECs support numerous first- and second-order quantum phase transitions
when the linear, \( p \), or quadratic, \( q \), Zeeman shifts are
ramped across a critical point~\cite{Kawaguchi2012}.
A second-order quantum phase transition is characterised by the continuous first
derivatives of the internal energy with respect to variations in \( p \) and
\( q \) at the critical point.
In this section, we aim to test the predictions of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism
for a second-order quantum phase transition in a spin-1 BEC\@.

\subsection{\label{sec: KZM-second-order-numerics}Polar to broken-axisymmetry
quench}
Motivated by previous work~\cite{Damski2007}, we will investigate the
Kibble-Zurek mechanism across the second-order phase transition occurring
between the polar and broken-axisymmetry phases in a ferromagnetic spin-1 BEC\@.
The polar phase is the energetic ground state when \( Q=q/|c_1|n > 2 \).
The critical point \( Q = 2 \) (for \(p=0\)) represents the second-order phase
transition to the BA phase.
The BA phase contains three Bogoliubov modes~\cite{Uchino2010}, but only one
is non-zero in the long wavelength limit (see
Sec.~\ref{subsec: bogoliubov-modes} for further details on Bogoliubov modes in
a spin-1 BEC).
This mode is gapped, and has the scaling form
\begin{equation}
    \Delta \sim \sqrt{4 - Q^2}.
\end{equation}
We temporally vary \(Q\) according to
\begin{equation}
    Q(t) = 2 - \frac{t}{\tau_Q},
    \label{eq: time-dep-Q-damski}
\end{equation}
where \( \tau_Q^{-1} \) is the quench rate.
To investigate Kibble-Zurek scaling, we consider the freeze-out time,
\( \tilde{t} \), which occurs when the equilibrium relaxation time is equal to
the rate of change of the control parameter [see
Eq.~\eqref{eq: freeze-out-equal}].
Using the above form of the linear quench, the freeze-out time is calculated
as~\cite{Damski2007}
\begin{equation}
    \tilde{t} \sim \tau_Q^{1/3}.
\end{equation}

We now analyse the resulting dynamics when linearly decreasing \( Q \) according
to Eq.~\eqref{eq: time-dep-Q-damski}, starting from the polar phase (\(t < 0\))
and end the simulation precisely at \( Q = 0 \) (\( t=2\tau_Q \)) in the BA
phase.
The initial state is a polar wave function that is slightly perturbed:
\begin{equation}
    \psi = \left(\delta\psi_1, \frac{1}{\sqrt{L}} + \delta\psi_0,
    \delta\psi_{-1}\right),
    \label{eq: peturbed-polar-initi-state}
\end{equation}
where \( |\delta\psi_m| \ll 1 / \sqrt{L} \) are small noise terms and \( L \) is
the length of the computational domain.
The real and imaginary parts of these terms at individual grid points are drawn
from the probability distribution
\( p(x) = \exp(-x^2/2\sigma^2)/\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma \).
To ensure we remain close to the polar ground state, we take
\( \sigma=10^{-4} \).
We consider a 1D system with \(N_x = 2048\) grid points with \(L=78\) and
choose dimensionless spin-independent interaction \(c_0=1.4\times10^5\) and
\(c_0/c_1 = -222\).
Note that these choice of parameters give a condensate close to that of
\(^{87}\)Rb, in which \(c_0/c_1 \approx -111\) (see
Sec.~\ref{subsec: experimental-params}).
We start with the initial state in Eq.~\eqref{eq: peturbed-polar-initi-state}
and integrate the spin-1 Gross-Pitaevskii equations using a symplectic
integrator~\cite{Symes2016}.

\subsection{Evolution of the transverse magnetisation}
To determine the freeze-out time within our system, we need to find a quantity
that grows as the transition point is crossed.
This freeze-out time is then measured by the time it takes for the onset of
that growth to occur.
The quantity that satisfies this condition in the polar to BA transition is the
transverse magnetisation
\begin{equation}
    M_\perp = \int \langle\hat{F}_x^2\rangle + |\langle\hat{F}_y^2\rangle|
    \, \dd z,
\end{equation}
where \(\hat{F}_x\) and \(\hat{F}_y \) are the \(x, y\) components of the
condensate spin vector, respectively.
In the polar phase this quantity is zero, but becomes non-zero in the BA limit
where it is \(M_\perp = (1 - Q^2/4)/L\).

        \(\tau_Q=11\).
        Plotted are the numerical values (black line) and the
        analytical prediction (red line).
        (b) The extracted value of \( \tilde{t} \) versus the quench time.
        Overlaid is the power-law scaling \(\tau_Q^{1/3}\).}
\end{figure}
Fig.~\ref{subfig: magnetisation-vs-Q} shows a typical evolution of the
transverse magnetisation for \(\tau_Q = 11\).
One sees that after the critical point is crossed at \( Q = 2 \), the transverse
magnetisation grows in a non-trivial fashion.
This growth starts precisely after the system exits the freeze-out stage, which
occurs at \(t=\tilde{t}\).
The magnetisation then grows rapidly, exceeding the analytical prediction at
certain time intervals, and begins to oscillate with the amplitude of the
oscillation decaying over time.
Using this quantity, we can test the Kibble-Zurek prediction in
Eq.~\eqref{eq: freeze-out-scaling}.

We define \( \tilde{t} \) as the instant when \(M_\perp L\) intersects 1\% of
the maximum value given by \(M_\perp L = 1\).
Fig~\ref{subfig: t-hat-vs-tau-q} shows the extracted value of \( \tilde{t} \)
for a range of \( \tau_Q \).
We see an unambiguous power-law scaling of \(\tau_Q^{1/3}\) for
\(\tau_Q \geq 10\).
The gradual departure from the \(\tilde{t} \sim \tau_Q^{1/3}\) scaling indicates
that the quench has to be sufficiently slow to capture the Kibble-Zurek scaling.
We note that the choice of the 1\% threshold used here is arbitrary.
We have tested a range of values up to a maximum of 10\%, and obtain
quantitatively similar behaviour for all values tested.

\section{Extending the Kibble-Zurek theory to first-order quantum phase
transitions}
The preceding sections were concerned with the KZM across second-order phase
transitions.
Describing the KZM across discontinuous, first-order transitions, however, has
been difficult due to lack of
universality~\cite{Turban2002,Continentino2004,Nauenberg1975}.
More recent work has aimed to bridge the gap between the KZM and first-order
transitions~\cite{Suzuki2015}, and here we present an overview of how the KZM
can be adapted to describe a discontinuous phase transition that will form the
focus in the remainder of this chapter.

Fisher and Berker~\cite{Fisher1982} demonstrated that first-order phase
transitions occurring at a DCP can also give rise to scaling behaviour.
Such a DCP results in a discontinuity in the order parameter as the critical
point is passed.
Despite this, the transition can still be characterised by a divergent length
scale, and hence, critical exponents can be derived.
Suzuki \textit{et al.}~\cite{Suzuki2015} aimed to extend the notion of a DCP to
a DQCP\@, of which we will summarise here.
Let us consider a system that contains a critical point at
\( q = q_c \), where \( q \) is a tunable parameter and contains
the presence of a symmetry-breaking field, \( p \).
For one to have a DQCP five conditions need to be satisfied.
Firstly, the energy density \( \epsilon(q, p) \) must be a continuous
function of \( q \) and \( p \) across the critical point
\begin{equation}
    \epsilon(q_c + 0, 0) = \epsilon(q_c - 0, 0).
    \label{eq: continuous-energy-cond}
\end{equation}
The derivative of this energy density, however, is discontinuous
\begin{equation}
    \pdv{\epsilon(q_c + 0, 0)}{q} \neq \pdv{\epsilon(q_c - 0, 0)}{q}.
\end{equation}
The order parameter \( m(q, p) \), where \( m=-\pdv{\epsilon(q, p)}{p} \),
has a discontinuous jump as a function of \( q \) as the critical point is
passed
\begin{equation}
    |m(q_c - 0, 0)| > m(q_c + 0, 0)| = 0,
\end{equation}
whilst also having a discontinuous jump as a function of \( p \)
\begin{equation}
    |m(q_c, \pm 0)| > 0.
\end{equation}
Finally, we require that the derivative of the energy density be bounded as
\( q \rightarrow q_c \pm 0 \)
\begin{equation}
    \left|\pdv{\epsilon(q_c \pm 0, 0)}{q}\right| < \infty.
    \label{eq: bounded-energy-derivative-cond}
\end{equation}
These five conditions encapsulate a DQCP\@.

\subsection{The Broken-axisymmetry to ferromagnetic transition as a
discontinuous quantum critical point}
Let us now consider a specific example.
We are interested in the phase transition that occurs between the
broken-axisymmetry (BA) and ferromagnetic (FM) phases.
The energy densities for the two states are given by~\cite{Kawaguchi2012}
\begin{equation}
    \epsilon_\mathrm{BA} = \frac{{(-p^2 + q^2 +2qc_1n)}^2}{8c_1nq^2}
    + \frac{1}{2}c_0n, \qquad
    \epsilon_\mathrm{FM_{\pm}} = \mp p + q + \frac{1}{2}n(c_0 + c_1),
\end{equation}
where \( \epsilon_\mathrm{FM_{\pm}} \) corresponds to the energy density in the
FM phase for the spinor \( \zeta = {(1, 0, 0)}^T \) (+) and
\( \zeta = {(0, 0, 1)}^T \) (-).
One sees that at the critical point \( q=q_c=0 \) and \( p=0 \) the energy is
continuous.
On the other hand, the derivative of the above energies with respect to \( q \)
yields
\begin{equation}
    \pdv{\epsilon_\mathrm{BA}}{q} =
    \frac{1}{4c_1n}\left(q - \frac{p^4}{q^3}\right) - \frac{p^2}{q^2}
    + \frac{1}{2},
    \qquad
    \pdv{\epsilon_\mathrm{FM_{\pm}}}{q} = 1.
\end{equation}
Indeed, there is a discontinuity in these derivatives at \( q=p=0 \), although
they still remain bounded.
The relevant order parameters for this transition are given by
\begin{equation}
    m_\mathrm{BA} = \frac{p(p^2 - q^2 - 2qc_1n)}{8c_1nq},
    \qquad
    m_{\mathrm{FM}_{\pm}} = \pm 1,
\end{equation}
which is precisely the local magnetisation, \(\hat{F}_z = |\psi_1|^2
- |\psi_{-1}|^2\), in both phases (see Sec.~\ref{sec: ground-states-spin-1}).
Again, one sees that at the critical point and for \( p=0 \) the order parameter
becomes zero in the BA phase whilst becoming non-zero in the FM phase.
In addition, as the linear Zeeman shift \( p \) is varied both above and below
zero, the order parameter becomes non-zero.
We have shown that the BA to FM phase transition satisfies all conditions
specified in Eqs.~\eqref{eq: continuous-energy-cond}
-\eqref{eq: bounded-energy-derivative-cond}
and therefore is a DQCP\@.

\subsection{\label{subsec: bogoliubov-modes}Determining the relevant Bogoliubov
mode}
In order to determine the relevant energy spectrum for our system, we consider
the Bogoliubov modes of the BA phase of a spin-1 BEC, which we derive explicitly
from the relevant Bogoliubov transformations.
The broken-axisymmetry phase can be parameterised as~\cite{Uchino2010}
\begin{align}
    \zeta^\text{BA} = \left(\frac{\sin\theta}{\sqrt{2}}, \cos\theta,
    \frac{\sin\theta}{\sqrt{2}}\right),
\end{align}
where \(\sin\theta = \sqrt{1/2+q/(4nc_1)}\).
Then, the fluctuation operators for this state are then defined
as~\cite{Uchino2010}:
\begin{align}
    \hat{a}_{\vb{k}, d} &= \frac{\sin\theta}{\sqrt{2}}(\hat{a}_{\vb{k}, 1}
    + \hat{a}_{\vb{k}, -1}) + \cos\theta \hat{a}_{\vb{k}, 0}, \\
    \hat{a}_{\vb{k}, f_z} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\hat{a}_{\vb{k}, 1}
    - \hat{a}_{\vb{k}, -1}), \label{eq: a_k-fz}\\
    \hat{a}_{\vb{k}, \theta} &= \frac{\cos\theta}{\sqrt{2}}(\hat{a}_{\vb{k}, 1}
    + \hat{a}_{\vb{k}, -1}) - \sin\theta \hat{a}_{\vb{k}, 0},
\end{align}
where on the right-hand side \(\hat{a}_{\vb{k}, m}\) is the annihilation
operator for a spin-\(1\) boson in magnetic level \(m\) (for \(m=-1,0,+1\)),
determined by expanding the wave function field operator as
\begin{align}
    \hat{\psi}_m(\vb{x}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{V}}\sum_{\vb{k}}
    \hat{a}_{\vb{k}, m}e^{i\vb{k}\cdot \vb{x}},
\end{align}
where \(V\) is the volume of the system.

The sub-Hamiltonian for the spin fluctuation mode \(\hat{a}_{\vb{k}, f_z}\) can
be diagonalised using the transformation
\begin{align}
    \hat{b}_{\vb{k}, f_z} = \sqrt{\frac{\epsilon_{\vb{k}} + q/2
    + E_{\vb{k}, f_z}}{2E_{\vb{k}, f_z}}}\hat{a}_{\vb{k}, f_z}
    + \sqrt{\frac{\epsilon_{\vb{k}} + q/2 - E_{\vb{k}, f_z}}{2E_{\vb{k}, f_z}}}
    \hat{a}_{-\vb{k}, f_z}^\dagger,
\end{align}
where \(\epsilon_{\vb{k}} = \hbar^2|\vb{k}|^2/2M\) is the kinetic energy.
The Bogoliubov spectrum is then given by
\begin{align}\label{eq: e_k-fz}
    E_{\vb{k}, {f_z}} = \sqrt{\epsilon_{\vb{k}}(\epsilon_{\vb{k}} + q)}.
\end{align}
The sub-Hamiltonians for the density fluctuation mode \(\hat{a}_{\vb{k}, d}\)
and the \(\theta \) mode
\(\hat{a}_{\vb{k}, \theta}\) can be similarly diagonalised using operators
\(\hat{b}_{\vb{k}, +}\) and \(\hat{b}_{\vb{k}, -}\), which yields the remaining
two Bogoliubov modes~\cite{Uchino2010}:
\begin{align}\label{eq: e_k-pm}
    E_{\vb{k}, \pm}= \sqrt{\epsilon_{\vb{k}}^2 + n(c_0-c_1)\epsilon_{\vb{k}}
        + 2{(nc_1)}^2(1 - \tilde{q}^2) \pm E_1(\vb{k})},
\end{align}
where \(\tilde{q} = -q/2c_1n\) and
\begin{align}
    E_1(\vb{k}) = \sqrt{{\left[n{(c_0 + 3c_1)}\epsilon_{\vb{k}}
                    + 2{(c_1n)}^2(1-\tilde{q}^2)\right]}^2
        - 4c_1(c_0+2c_1){(n\tilde{q}\epsilon_{\vb{k}})}^2}.
\end{align}
The final, diagonalised Hamiltonian then reads
\begin{align}
    \hat{H}^\text{BA} =\, E_0^\text{BA}
    + \sum_{\vb{k} \neq 0}\left[E_{\vb{k}, f_z}\hat{b}^\dagger_{\vb{k}, f_z}
    \hat{b}_{\vb{k}, f_z}
    + E_{\vb{k}, -}\hat{b}^\dagger_{\vb{k}, -}\hat{b}_{\vb{k}, -}
    + E_{\vb{k}, +}\hat{b}^\dagger_{\vb{k}, +}\hat{b}_{\vb{k}, +}\right],
\end{align}
where \(E_0^\text{BA}\) is the ground state energy for the
BA phase~\cite{Uchino2010}.

For simplicity, we now consider a 1D system.
In the long-wavelength limit (\(k \rightarrow 0\)), the only non-zero (gapped)
mode is given by \(E_{k, +}= \sqrt{4{(c_1n)}^2(1-\tilde{q})}\), which has the
form \(E_{k, +} \sim \sqrt{{q_c^\prime}^2 - q^2}\), where
\(q_c^\prime = 2c_1n\).
The relevant mode for the BA to FM transition can be found by considering the
imaginary parts of the derived Bogoliubov energies (see
Fig.~\ref{fig: dens-spin-energies}).
\begin{figure}[tb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{gfx/ch-spin1/bogoliubov_energies.pdf}
    \caption[Real and imaginary parts of the Bogoliubov energies for the
        broken-axisymmetry phase of a spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate]
    {\label{fig: dens-spin-energies}Imaginary parts of the energies defined in
    Eq.~\eqref{eq: e_k-fz} and Eq.~\eqref{eq: e_k-pm} in a parameter space of
    mode \(k\) and \( Q=q/|c_1|n \).
    Note that \(E_{k, -} = 0\) for our range of \(k\) and hence is not shown.}
\end{figure}
For \(|Q|>2\), \(\text{Im}(E_{k, +})\) becomes non-zero, indicating an
instability.
The critical point \(Q = 2\) corresponds to the second-order phase transition
from the polar to the BA phase, indicating that \(E_{k, +}\) is the desired
Bogoliubov energy for that particular transition.
However, we see that for \(Q<0\) the imaginary part of \(E_{k, f_z}\) becomes
non-zero, and hence unstable.
This critical point corresponds to the transition between the BA and FM phases,
which precisely describes our transition of interest.
Therefore, \(E_{k, f_z}\) is the correct Bogoliubov mode for our transition.
Note that for \(k=0\) an instability does not occur in the \(E_{k, f_z}\) mode,
and so studies focussing on this mode in particular (the so-called uniform mode
approximation) will not capture the phase transition that occurs at
\(Q=0\)~\cite{Matuszewski2009, Qiu2020, Mirkhalaf2021}.
In contrast, choosing the \(k=0\) mode is sufficient to capture the phase
transition at \(Q=2\) since it is the most unstable mode indicated in
\(E_{k, +}\).
In practice, the \(Q=-2\) transition is not realised since the instability at
\(Q=0\) for any \(k \neq 0\) will typically arise and take precedent when
\(Q\) is quenched from positive to negative values.

\subsection{Predicting the density of defects}
Recall from Sec~\ref{sec: the-KZM} that the density of defects takes the form
\(N_d \simeq \xi^{-d}\).
Therefore, to predict the density of defects for the BA to FM transition, we
need to find the appropriate form for the correlation length, \(\xi \).
With the relevant Bogoliubov mode found, we can predict the scaling of the
density of defects for a BA to FM phase transition.
Since our relevant mode is gapless, it is instructive to consider a
generalisation of the spectrum, given by
\begin{align}\label{eq: dispersion-relation}
    E_k^2 \sim |q(t)-q_c|^{\alpha}\epsilon_k^{\eta}+\epsilon_k^{2z}.
\end{align}
We focus on the case of approaching the critical point from the BA phase, since
this determines the crossover from the adiabatic regime to the
impulse regime which sets the metastable state after the DQCP is crossed.
To be consistent with the KZM, where \(E_k \sim |q(t)-q_c|^{z}\), we make
the ansatz \(k \sim \xi^{-1} \sim |q(t)-q_c|^{\nu}\), equivalent to
\(k \sim \xi^{-1}\).
For a scaling solution to arise that is consistent with the relaxation time,
we require \(E_k \sim k^z\).
This, combined with Eq.~\eqref{eq: dispersion-relation}, leads us to the
relation
\begin{align}
    \alpha = \nu (2z-\eta).
\end{align}
Now, in our system, we have \(q_c = 0\) and \(q = -t/\tau_Q\) and thus
Eq.~\eqref{eq: dispersion-relation} simplifies to
\begin{align}\label{eq: dispersion-relation-simplified}
    E_k^2 \sim \frac{|t|^{\alpha}}{\tau_Q^{\alpha}}k^{\eta}.    
\end{align}

Recall now the adiabatic-impulse approximation described in
Sec.~\ref{sec: the-KZM}, with an energy gap given by \(\Delta(t)\).
In this case, the relaxation time scales as \(\tau \sim 1/\Delta \), which
implies that far from the critical point the relaxation time is small, and the
system adiabatically follows the instantaneous ground state.
However, as the critical point is approached \(\Delta \rightarrow 0\), and the
relaxation time then diverges.
At some time \(\tilde{t}\) the relaxation time becomes comparable to the
transition time, \(\Delta / \dot{\Delta}\), and the system can no longer
adiabatically follow the ground state.
This time (often denoted the freezing time), \(\tilde{t}\), signifies the onset
of the impulse regime, where the system becomes frozen.
Therefore, the freezing time can be evaluated from the expression
\begin{align}
    \frac{1}{\Delta(\tilde{t})} \sim
    \frac{\Delta(\tilde{t})}{\dot{\Delta}(\tilde{t})} .
\end{align}

For our gapless spectrum, we work with a dispersion relation of the form given
by Eq.~\eqref{eq: dispersion-relation-simplified}.
Then, the adiabatic-impulse approximation states that \(E_k^2 = \dot{E}_k\),
which leads to
\begin{align}
    \frac{\alpha}{2\tau_Q^{\alpha/2}}|\tilde{t}|^{(\alpha/2 - 1)}
    \tilde{k}^{\eta/2} \sim \frac{|\tilde{t}|^{\alpha}}{\tau_Q^{\alpha}}
    \tilde{k}^{\eta},
\end{align}
which then leads us directly to the freezing time
\begin{align}\label{eq: freeze-t}   
    |\tilde{t}| \sim \tau_Q^{\alpha/(2+\alpha)}
    \tilde{k}^{-\eta/(2+\alpha)} \sim
    \tau_Q^{\nu z/(1+\nu z)}.
\end{align}
Now, to obtain the characteristic momentum scale, we substitute
Eq.~\eqref{eq: freeze-t} back into
Eq.~\eqref{eq: dispersion-relation-simplified}, which yields
\begin{align}
    \tilde{k} \sim \tau_Q^{-\nu/(z\nu + 1)}.
\end{align}
The density of defects is then finally calculated as
\begin{align}
    N_d \sim \tilde{k}^d \sim \tau_Q^{-d\nu/(z\nu + 1)},
\end{align}
where \(d\) is the dimensionality of the system.
Hence, we have shown how the density of defects can be predicted for a system
containing a gapless spectrum.

For the BA to FM transition specifically, Eq.~\eqref{eq: e_k-fz} implies that
\(\alpha=1\), \(\eta=2\), and \(z = 2\).
Considering a 1D system (\(d = 1\)), that leads to a scaling of the density of
defects as
\begin{align}\label{eq: BA-FM-defects-scaling}
    N_d \sim\tau_Q^{-1/4},
\end{align}
which corresponds to choosing \(z=2\) and \(\nu = 1/2\) in
Eq.~\eqref{eq: KZM-defects-scaling}.
Despite the Hamiltonian of our model being the same as previous works, this
scaling obtained is different from that reported in previous studies on the KZM
in spinor BECs~\cite{Damski2007,Saito2007,Saito2007a,Saito2013,Swislocki2013}.
These studies focused on continuous phase transitions through a QCP\@, and our
results indicate a new scaling regime that is associated specifically with the
DQCP of this system.

\subsection{Extracting a power-law scaling near the critical point}
Having identified the relevant mode of the transition, we now follow a procedure
similar to Damski~\cite{Damski2007} and analytically determine the scaling
behaviour of the system near the critical point by linearising our system of
equations.
To begin, we start with a wave function close to the BA state
\begin{equation}\label{eq: spin-1-perturbed-BA-state}
    \Psi^T = \left(\frac{\sqrt{2n_0}}{4}\sqrt{2 - Q_0} + \delta\psi_{1}(t),
    \frac{\sqrt{n_0}}{2}\sqrt{2 + Q_0} + \delta \psi_0(t),
    \frac{\sqrt{2n_0}}{4}\sqrt{2 - Q_0} + \delta\psi_{-1}(t)\right)e^{-i\mu t},
\end{equation}
where \( 0 < Q_0 < 2 \) is a constant, \(\mu \) is the
chemical potential and \( |\delta\psi_m| \ll 1 \) are time-dependent noise
terms.
The noise terms must satisfy \(\int \sum_m\delta\psi_m+\delta\psi_m^* \, \dd z\)
to ensure normalisation of the wave function.
Additionally, they must also satisfy \(\int (\delta\psi_1 + \delta\psi_1^* 
\delta\psi_{-1} + \delta\psi_{-1}^*) \dd z = 0\) to ensure that magnetisation
is conserved.

Recall the spin-1 GPEs are given as (see Sec.~\ref{subsec: spin-1-gpes}):
\begin{align}\label{eq: spin-1-KZ-GPEs}
    i\hbar\pdv{\Psi}{t} = \left[ -\frac{\hbar^2\nabla^2}{2M}
    -pf_z + qf_z^2 +c_0n +c_1n\langle \hat{\vb{F}}\rangle
    \cdot \hat{\vb{F}}\right]\Psi.
\end{align}
Substituting Eq.~\eqref{eq: spin-1-perturbed-BA-state} into the above equations
and keeping terms linear in \(\delta\psi_m\) yields the following two
equations for \(\delta\psi_{\pm 1}\) (\(p=0\))
\begin{multline}\label{eq: dpsi1}
    i\hbar\pdv{\delta\psi_1}{t} = \left[-\frac{\hbar^2}{2M}\pdv[2]{}{z}+q-\mu
    + \frac{n_0(10c_0+6c_1-(c_0-c_1)Q)}{8}\right]\delta\psi_1 \\
    + \frac{n_0\sqrt{2(4-Q^2)}}{8}\left[
        (c_0 + 3c_1)\delta\psi_0
        + (c_0+c_1)\delta\psi_0^*
    \right] \\
    + \frac{n_0(2-Q)}{8}\left[(c_0-c_1)\delta\psi_{-1}
    + (c_0+c_1)\delta\psi_1^*\right]
    + \frac{n_0}{8}\left[(2-Q)c_0 + (2+3Q)c_1\right]\delta\psi_{-1}^*,
\end{multline}
\begin{multline}\label{eq: dpsim1}
    i\hbar\pdv{\delta\psi_{-1}}{t} = \left[-\frac{\hbar^2}{2M}\pdv[2]{}{z}+q-\mu
    + \frac{n_0(10c_0+6c_1-(c_0-c_1)Q)}{8}\right]\delta\psi_{-1} \\
    + \frac{n_0\sqrt{2(4-Q^2)}}{8}\left[
        (c_0 + 3c_1)\delta\psi_0
        + (c_0+c_1)\delta\psi_0^*
    \right] \\
    + \frac{n_0(2-Q)}{8}\left[(c_0-c_1)\delta\psi_{1}
    + (c_0+c_1)\delta\psi_{-1}^*\right]
    + \frac{n_0}{8}\left[(2-Q)c_0 + (2+3Q)c_1\right]\delta\psi_{1}^*.
\end{multline}
Now, subtracting Eq.~\eqref{eq: dpsim1} from Eq.~\eqref{eq: dpsi1} results in
the partial differential equation
\begin{align}\label{eq: G_y-unsimplified}
    i\hbar\pdv{G_y}{t}= \left[ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2M}\pdv[2]{}{z}+q
    -\mu+n_0(c_0+c_1)\right]G_y
    -\frac{c_1n_0Q}{2}G_y^*,
\end{align}
where \(G_y = \delta\psi_1 - \delta\psi_{-1}\).
The chemical potential of the system is calculated from the \(\psi_0\)
component of Eq.~\eqref{eq: spin-1-KZ-GPEs} by keeping leading order terms and
assuming a stationary state which leads to
\(\mu=c_0n_0 + c_1n_0(2 - Q_0)/2\).
Using this expression for the chemical potential and \(q(t) = -c_1n_0Q(t)\)
Eq.~\eqref{eq: G_y-unsimplified} simplifies to
\begin{align}\label{eq: G_y-simplified}
    i\hbar\pdv{G_y}{t} = \left[ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2M}\pdv[2]{}{z}
    -c_1n_0\left(Q-\frac{Q_0}{2}\right)\right]G_y
    - \frac{c_1n_0Q}{2}G_y^*.
\end{align}

To proceed with our analysis, we now split \(G_y\) into real and imaginary parts
and make use of Fourier transforms, \(a_y=\int \text{Re}(G_y)e^{ikz} dz\) and
\(b_y=\int \text{Im}(G_y)e^{ikz} dz\) to progress our analysis.
Substituting these expressions in Eq.~\eqref{eq: G_y-simplified} yields the
following matrix equation
\begin{align}\label{eq: a_y-matrix}
    \dv{t}\mqty[a_y \\ b_y] = \mqty(0 & \frac{\hbar k^2}{2M}
    - \frac{c_1  n_0}{2\hbar}(Q - Q_0) \\
    \frac{c_1  n_0}{2\hbar} \left( 3Q-Q_0 \right)-\frac{\hbar k^2}{2M} & 0)
    \mqty[a_y \\ b_y].
 \end{align}
To solve the above system of equations, we rewrite the equation in terms of a
single \(\dv[2]{a_y}{t}\) and substitute the critical point value \(Q=0\) to
obtain
\begin{align}
    \dv[2]{a_y}{t} = \frac{c_1n_0}{2\hbar\tau_Q}b_y
    + \left(\frac{\hbar^2k^2}{2M} - \frac{c_1n_0Q}{2\hbar}\right)\dv{b_y}{t}.
\end{align}
Now, expressions for \(b_y\) and \(\dv{b_y}{t}\) can be found from
Eq.~\eqref{eq: a_y-matrix}, which transforms the above equation to
\begin{align}
    \dv[2]{a_y}{t} = \frac{1}{\tau_Q\left(\frac{\hbar^2k^2}{Mc_1n_0}
    - Q\right)}\dv{a_y}{t}
    - \left(\frac{\hbar^2k^4}{4M^2} - \frac{k^2c_1n_0Q}{M}
    + \frac{3c_1^2n_0^2Q^2}{4\hbar^2}\right)a_y.
\end{align}
Finally, to simplify the above expression, we use the spin healing length
\(\xi_s = \hbar/\sqrt{2|c_1|n_0}\) and the spin time
\(\tau_s=\hbar/(|c_1|n_0)\), along with the substitution \(Q=-t/\tau_Q\):
\begin{align}
  \dv[2]{a_y}{t} = \frac{-1}{\left(2\xi_s^2 k^2 \tau_Q- t \right)}\dv{a_y}{t}
  -\left( \frac{\xi_s^4 k^4}{4\tau_s^2} -\frac{\xi_s^2 k^2 t}{2\tau_s^2 \tau_Q}
  + \frac{3 t^2}{16\tau_s^2 \tau_Q^2} \right) a_y.
\end{align}

Now, to extract scaling solutions, we rescale time as \(t\rightarrow t\lambda \)
where \(\lambda = \sqrt{\tau_s\tau_Q}\), which leads to the final differential
equation
\begin{align} \label{eq: eqn-scaled-lin}
    \dv[2]{a_y}{t} = \frac{-1}{\left( 2\kappa^2 - t\right)}\dv{a_y}{t}
    -\frac{1}{4} \left( \kappa^4 - 2\kappa^2 t + \frac{3 t^2}{4} \right)a_y,
\end{align}
where \(\kappa^2 = \xi_s^2 k^2 \sqrt{\tau_Q/\tau_s}\).
This scaling ensures that the last term of the above equation is independent of
\(\tau_Q\).
Then, the remaining dependence on \(\tau_Q\) is eliminated if we require that
\(\kappa \) is constant, implying that \(k \sim \tau_Q^{-1/4}\).
Under these conditions, we have now, independent of the KZM, derived scaling
solutions for \(k\), which are seen to be consistent with the alternatively
derived scaling of the density of defects following the KZ theory (compare the
above scaling for \(k\) with the density of defects given in
Eq.~\eqref{eq: BA-FM-defects-scaling}).
The main advantage of this approach over the KZM is in treating the
time-dependence of the quadratic Zeeman shift directly rather than working with
instantaneous dispersion relation as in the standard KZM\@.
The agreement of the scaling obtained from the two methods provides further
verification of the validity of the arguments used to extend the KZM to our
gapless spectrum.

\section{Numerical studies of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism across a discontinuous
quantum phase transition}
\subsection{Broken-axisymmetry to ferromagnetic quench}
To check our predictions, we perform numerical simulations of a spin-1
Bose-Einstein condensate crossing a DQCP\@.
We start from the BA wave function with (\( p=0 \)):
\begin{equation}
    \psi_{\pm 1} = \frac{\sqrt{2n_0}}{4}\sqrt{2 - Q(t)}, \qquad
    \psi_0 = \frac{\sqrt{n_0}}{2}\sqrt{2 + Q(t)},
    \label{eq: BA-initial-wavefunction}
\end{equation}
where \(Q(t)=q(t)/|c_1|n\) and \(n_0\) is the background density in a uniform
system.
The BA wave function is the ground state for \(c_1 < 0\) and \(0 < Q < 2\).
There exists a critical point at \( Q = 0 \) where the ground state changes from
the BA phase to the ferromagnetic phase.
To check our predictions of the previous section we perform mean-field numerical
simulations of this quench by integrating the spin-1 GPEs using a symplectic
integrator~\cite{Symes2016}.
We measure length and time in units of the spin healing length, \(\xi_s\), and
the spin time, \(\tau_s\), respectively.
Our simulations are performed on a 1D grid of \(N_z = 16384\) grid points with a
grid spacing of \(\Delta_z = 0.125\xi_s\), and we consider a ring-shaped
geometry by assuming periodic boundary conditions and \(V(z) = 0\).
We follow the same methodology as in the continuous QPT discussed in
Sec.~\ref{sec: KZM-second-order-numerics} and perturb the initial BA state by
adding small noise, \(\delta_m\), to each component where \(|\delta_m| \ll 1\).
Then, we generate the real and imaginary parts of \(\delta_m\) for each grid
point using the probability distribution
\(p(z) = e^{-z^2/2\sigma^2}{(\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma)}^{-1}\), choosing
\(\sigma=10^{-4}\) so that we start close to the BA ground state.

\subsection{Phase boundaries in the ferromagnetic phase}
As the system is quenched across the critical point at \( Q = 0 \), the ground
state changes to the ferromagnetic phase.
The order parameter for this phase takes the form \(\psi={(\sqrt{n_0},0,0)}^T\)
or \(\psi={(0,0,\sqrt{n_0})}^T\) depending on the orientation of the spin.
From Eq.~\eqref{eq: BA-initial-wavefunction}, however, we have
\(\psi_{\pm 1} = \frac{\sqrt{n_0}}{2}\) and \(\psi_0 = \frac{\sqrt{2n_0}}{2}\)
at \( Q = 0 \).
The question that remains is: Which state will the system choose after
the critical point is passed?

\begin{figure}[tb]

        spatial subregion of the condensate for
        \( \tau_Q=1000\tau_s \).
        After the critical point is passed (\(t/\tau_s=0\)), FM domains form in
        the \(\psi_{\pm 1}\) components, indicated by the bright density peaks.
        The location of a bright density peak in one component matches with a
        density minimum in the other component, showcasing the opposite
        spin-projection.}
\end{figure}
Fig.~\ref{fig: BA-FM-densities} shows the full evolution of the density of each
component for a quench time \( \tau_Q=1000\tau_s \).
As the Zeeman shift is quenched, we see the density of the \(\psi_0\) component
linearly decrease as the \(\psi_{\pm 1}\) components increase.
After the critical point at \(t/\tau_s=0\) is passed, there is a freeze-out time
(see Sec.~\ref{sec: the-KZM}) before the system crosses into the ferromagnetic
phase.
During this new phase, we see the formation of ferromagnetic domain walls
(characterised by the bright density peaks) in the \(\psi_{\pm 1}\) components
as the order parameter adjusts to the new ground state.
These domains are spatially separated and where there is zero density in one of
the components, there is maximal density in the other, so that overall the total
density \(n=\sum_m\psi_m^*\psi_m\) is uniform.

The KZM predicts in Eq.~\eqref{eq: KZM-domain-size} that the size of the domains
grow as the quench rate decreases.

\end{figure}
Fig.~\ref{fig: BA-FM-domain-width-comparison} shows the average domain size
for two different simulations with \(\tau_Q=500\) and \(\tau_Q=5000\).
We see that the quench with larger \(\tau_Q\) produces domains that have a
larger width than those of faster quenches, supporting the Kibble-Zurek theory.
In addition, we plot the time evolution of \(|\psi_1|^2\) for \(\tau_Q=500\)
and \(\tau_Q=1000\) in Fig.~\ref{fig: BA-FM-domain-onset}.
We see the ferromagnetic domain formation is delayed in the simulation
with a slower quench rate, again supporting the prediction in
Eq.~\eqref{eq: freeze-out-scaling}.

One can count the number of ferromagnetic domains in the system and see the
dependence on \( \tau_Q \).
To do this, we identified that each domain is associated with a corresponding
density peak, and subsequently developed a numerical algorithm that counts the
number of density peaks in each component and sums the result to give the total
number of domains, \(N_d\).
We calculate this quantity at the end of each simulation to ensure that the
domains are frozen and avoid the early-time coarsening taking place which could
affect the total number of domains present.

\end{figure}
In Fig.~\ref{fig: FM-domains-scaling} we plot the total number of domains
as a function of the quench time, where each point represents fifty ensemble
runs for each simulation.
We find excellent agreement with the predicted value of
\(N_d \sim \tau_Q^{-1/4}\) for sufficiently fast quenches (\(\tau_Q < 2
\times 10^3\)).
However, for slower quenches, a clear deviation from the predicted scaling
occurs.
Similar deviation from the predicted KZM scaling has been observed in other
works where the quantities investigated were measured far past the critical
point~\cite{Su2013, Swislocki2013}.
The deviation observed in our system can be attributed to a crossover into a
different regime that follows the predictions of a Landau-Zener
model~\cite{Zurek2005,Damski2005, Pellegrini2008,Divakaran2008}.

\subsection{Power-law scaling near the critical point}
Since we know the relevant unstable mode within our system, we can investigate
power-law scaling near the critical point.
To begin, we start with the fluctuation operator associated with the
Bogoliubov spectrum \(E_{k, fz}\) given in Eq.~\eqref{eq: a_k-fz}.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}{0.45\textwidth}
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]

        \caption{\label{fig: fluctuation-diff}}
    \end{subfigure}
    \begin{subfigure}{0.45\textwidth}
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{gfx/ch-spin1/BA-FM_Qa_scaling.pdf}
        \caption{\label{fig: Q_a-scaling}}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption[Growth of the fluctuation operator, \(\hat{a}_{k, f_z}\),
    immediately after the transition point is crossed]
    {(a): The modulus of the fluctuation operator in Eq.~\eqref{eq: a_k-fz} for
    \(k=1\) and \(\tau_Q=5000\).
    The plot shown is obtained by averaging over all runs in the ensemble.
    (b): The critical value \(|Q_a|\) as a function of the quench time. Each
    point represents an ensemble of 50 runs, and the error bars give \(\pm 1\)
    standard deviation.
    }
\end{figure}
Fig.~\ref{fig: fluctuation-diff} shows the above quantity for a quench time
of \(\tau_Q=5000\) with \(k=1\).
The quantity remains zero until after the critical point is passed, where
a rapid period of growth occurs.
This onset of this growth corresponds to the ferromagnetic domains forming
within the system (see Fig.~\ref{fig: BA-FM-densities}).
Motivated by previous work~\cite{Damski2007, Qiu2020}, we define a time,
\( \tilde{t} \), which is the time when \(|\hat{a}_{k, {f_z}}|\) first
exceeds 1\% of its maximum value: \(|\hat{a}_{k, {f_z}}(\tilde{t})| =
0.01\times \max|\hat{a}_{k, {f_z}}(t)|\).
Using this time, we can extract the critical value of \( q \) that this growth
occurs at, \(Q(\tilde{t}) = Q_a\).
Fig.~\ref{fig: Q_a-scaling} shows \(|Q_a|\) as a function of the quench time.
We see a clear power-law scaling of \(Q_a \sim \tau_Q^{-\frac{1}{2}}\) for
all values of \( \tau_Q \) tested.
This exponent differs from observed results in previous works investigating
second-order phase transitions~\cite{Damski2007, Anquez2016, Swislocki2013}
where an exponent of \(-1/3\) is observed.
Our observation of a \(-1/2\) exponent signifies a deviation from
the Kibble-Zurek theory which appears to be a consequence of the properties of
the DQCP\@.

\subsection{Crossing two phase transitions}
To test the robustness of the observed scaling, we combine the effort of the
previous two numerical studies into one.
Namely, we investigate the scaling of the density of defects using a simulation
that spans two phase transitions.
Starting from the polar phase at \(Q  = 2.5\), we quench the quadratic Zeeman
shift such that we cross over to the BA phase at \(Q=2\) and finally the FM
phase at \(Q=0\).
This quench then evidently spans two phase transitions: one second-order, and
one first-order.
Our numerical set up is exactly the same as the previous section.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{gfx/ch-spin1/polar-BA-FM_domains.pdf}
    \caption[Total number of ferromagnetic domains as a function of the quench
    rate after the system has crossed two phase transitions]
    {\label{fig: polar-ba-fm-defects}Number of ferromagnetic domains as
    a function of the quench time, \(\tau_Q\), after the system has crossed two
    phase transitions.
    Each point is averaged over 5 runs, with the error bars giving \(\pm 1\)
    standard deviation.}
\end{figure}
We once again count the number of ferromagnetic domains present at the end of
the simulation when the system is in the FM phase.
Results for the density of defects are plotted in
Fig.~\ref{fig: polar-ba-fm-defects}.
Despite passing through two phase transitions, we observe qualitatively similar
behaviour to that of previous transition crossing only the first-order phase
transition (see Fig.~\ref{fig: FM-domains-scaling}).
For fast quenches (\(\tau_Q \lesssim 10^3 \)), the scaling of the density of
defects follows closely to \(N_d \sim \tau_Q^{-1/4}\).
Similar to the previous case, there is a deviation from this scaling when the
quench time becomes slower (\(\tau_Q > 10^3\)).
This shows that the scaling of the density of defects for fast quenches is
robust, and is unaffected by passing through other phase transitions.

\section{Conclusions}
In this chapter we have investigated the KZM across both second-order,
continuous QPTs and first-order, discontinuous QPTs using a spin-1 BEC with
\(c_1 < 0\)as a test bed system.
We initially reproduced a known result, and showed that the KZM accurately
predicted observed scaling laws across a second-order, continuous QPT in a
spin-1 BEC between the polar and BA phases.
In particular, we measured the freeze-out time directly by measuring the time at
which the transverse magnetisation (initially zero in the polar phase) became
non-zero after crossing to the BA phase.

The primary work of this chapter consisted of analytical and numerical
investigations into a first-order, discontinuous QPT across the BA and FM
phases in a spin-1 BEC with \(c_1 < 0\).
We showed that by accounting for a gapless dispersion relation, the KZM can be
generalised to such a discontinuous QPT, which, for our spin-1 system in
question, lead to a scaling of the density of defects as
\(N_d \sim \tau_Q^{-1/4}\).
The observed scaling laws of our generalised KZM differed from those observed
across continuous quantum critical points for the same spin-1 BEC model
discussed initially.
Furthermore, by linearising the resulting spinor GPEs, we obtained scaling laws
governing the growth of the unstable excitations as the system transitions to
the FM phase.

Numerical simulations provided excellent agreement for both the short-time
growth of unstable excitations in addition to the number of FM domains formed
after the critical point was passed.
The robustness of our theory was confirmed by performing similar simulations
which crossed both a second-order QPT (polar to BA) and a first-order QPT
(BA to FM), which gave quantitatively similar results to the previously observed
scaling laws.
