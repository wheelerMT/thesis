\chapter{Elements of Bose-Einstein condensates}

In this chapter we provide the theoretical background to understand the 
dynamics of ultracold atomic gases.

\section{The scalar BEC}

\section{The spin-1 BEC}
As we have seen in \textcolor{red}{relevant section}, the use of strong 
magnetic fields to trap the condensate freezes out the spin of atoms.
However, in recent years optical traps have been used in which the atomic 
spin is no longer frozen out, opening up a rich new avenue of ground-state
manifolds and topological defects that can be studied in-depth
\textcolor{red}{REF?}.
Perhaps the most common case is the spin-1 bose-einstein condensate.
The non-interacting Hamiltonian of such a system is given by
