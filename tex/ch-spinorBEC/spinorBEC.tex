\chapter{Spinor Bose-Einstein condensates}

In this chapter we provide the theoretical background to understand the 
dynamics of ultracold atomic gases.

\section{Single-particle Hamiltonian}
Spinor systems comprise particles with total spin \(f\).
This implies there are \(2f + 1\) possible spin states along a given spin
quantisation axis.
Such a state is denoted \(\ket{f, m} \), where
\(m \in \{-f, -f+1, \ldots, 0, \ldots, f - 1, f\} \) denotes the magnetic
sublevel for total spin \( f\).

A general spin-\(f\) state is described by the (\(2f+1\))-component wave
function \(\psi \), defined as \(\ket{\psi} = \sum_m\psi_m\ket{f, m}\).
In the spin-1 case, we have \(\psi = {(\psi_1, \psi_0, \psi_{-1})}^T\), and for
the spin-2 case \(\psi = {(\psi_2, \psi_1, \psi_0, \psi_{-1}, \psi_{-2})}^T\).

We start by first introducing the single-particle Hamiltonian for spinor BECs.
We assume a system of identical bosons of mass \(M\) and spin \(f\).
When a magnetic field is applied to a spinor system, the field causes energy
shifts in spin components.
When this field is aligned along the spin quantisation axis, linear, \(p\), and
quadratic, \(q\), Zeeman shifts arise.
In such a case, the single-particle (non-interacting) Hamiltonian is given
by~\cite{Kawaguchi2012}
\begin{equation}\label{eq: single-particle-Hamiltonian}
    H_0 = \int d\vb{r}\sum_{m,m'=-f}^{f} \psi_m^\dagger \left[
        -\frac{\hbar^2}{2M}\nabla^2 + V(\vb{r}) - pm + qm^2\right]\psi_{m'},
\end{equation}
where \(V(\vb{r})\) is a trapping potential.
Throughout most of this thesis we assume that the magnetic field applied is
uniform, such that the Zeeman shifts are constant.
In Chapter~\ref{chap: spin-1}, however, we introduce a time-dependent field
such that the quadratic Zeeman shift has a time-dependence.
Despite the time-dependence, the quadratic Zeeman shift is still spatially
uniform.

It becomes apparent from Eq.~\eqref{eq: single-particle-Hamiltonian} that the
quadratic shift uniformly alters the energetic separation between the
\(\psi_{\pm 1}\) and \(\psi_0\) components.
Conversely, the linear shift maintains the separation.

\section{Scalar BEC interactions}
The many-body nature of BEC systems leads to interactions that arise between
particles.
We begin by first discussing the interactions arising in the simplest BEC: the
scalar BEC.
We consider a gas of identical bosons, described by the complex order parameter,
\(\psi \).
Collisions of two particles at location \(\vb{r}_1, \vb{r}_2\) is given by
\begin{equation}
    E_\mathrm{int} = .
\end{equation}
