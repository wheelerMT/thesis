Due to their rich family of topological defects and ground state phases, spinor
Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) present an experimentally accessible quantum
emulator of universal phenomena that appear ubiquitously across physics, of
which some are difficult or impossible to study in the laboratory.
In this thesis we analytically and numerically investigate a variety of such
phenomena in pseudospin-1/2, spin-1, and spin-2 BECs, ranging from relaxation
dynamics, to quantum phase transitions, and even topological interfaces. 
Our investigations start with the relaxation dynamics of quantum turbulence in a
two-component Bose-Einstein condensate containing half-quantum vortices.
We show that spatial aspects of the dynamics contain similarities to equivalent
studies in scalar BECs, despite our system containing topologically distinct
vortices.
The temporal scaling of the number of vortices and the correlation lengths are
shown to be, at early times, strongly dependent on the relative strength of the
interspecies interaction.
At later times, the scaling is observed to be universal, independent
of the interspecies interaction, and follows scaling laws observed in the
relaxation dynamics of scalar BECs.
A spin-1 BEC is then used as an example system for investigating scaling
behaviour in a discontinuous (first-order) quantum phase transition.
We show how the Kibble-Zurek mechanism can be generalised and applied to our
system, which gives associated scaling laws different from those observed in
continuous quantum phase transitions.
Our predictions are confirmed by mean-field numerical simulations and provide
an experimentally accessible system for investigating properties of the decay of
metastable states.
Spin-2 BECs exhibit multiple ground state phases with continuous or discrete
symmetries, making excellent candidates for studying topological interfaces.
We analytically construct sets of spinor wave functions that continuously
connect two distinct ground state phases, and show how topologically distinct
defects and textures can be created that either terminate at the interface or
continuously penetrate across it, connecting non-trivially to an object
representing a different topology on the other side.
By performing numerical simulations of select examples, we show that defects
connected across the interface undergo a range of dynamics, including the
formation of composite cores and complex splitting processes.
